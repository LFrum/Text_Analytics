An amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat. Brilliantly orchestrated in its timing, and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release. The acting was generally well-done (the "Director" should've asked **** ******** for acting lessons), and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as ***** tries to race to the door in the studio). This movie didn't let up since the opening scene...
