Just after having moved into his new cottage in the English country, ******* ****** gets an invitation to dinner from *** ***** and **** *********, the owners of a large mansion nearby. But the next day, one of the guests is found shot near the pool, and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away....<br /><br />This Agatha Christie mystery is somewhat thin, though the killer's plan is still very clever. It's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level. This episode mostly keeps the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "*** *******", but contains more dark humor than them. The cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point, ****** *** (as the butler) and ***** ***** (as **** *********), though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful ***** ***** as the ahead-of-her-time Henrietta: her one-on-one confrontations with ****** sparkle and are the highlights of the film. Oh, and since an English police inspector does get involved in the case, I think they could have brought ****** ******* back for this one. (***)
