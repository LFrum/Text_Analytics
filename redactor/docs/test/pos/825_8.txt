After 10 years, it is finally save to say that our Belgian Action Star is back again. I personally found this one to be even better than Wake Of Death, which makes it his best movie in... 10 years!! Okay, it is not like his highlight years as *******, ********* *******, ****** ***** or even his best effort to date: **** ****** (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors **** ***.) The Action is good, the story is exciting, the dialogue is quite funny, this one is better than expected.The bad guys are awesome like in **** ******, and the fight scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I must say, I gave up on him, but *** ***** is finally back. More Please....
