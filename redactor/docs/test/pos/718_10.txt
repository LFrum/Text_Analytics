******** **********'s "Art for Teachers of Children" is a stunning, disturbing masterpiece. **********'s gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old ********'s seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor. The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing ******** (******* ***** McDonnell) and ********'s mother (actually voiced by Ruth **********) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen captured on film. The lesson ultimately learned here? "There's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." Well, I would highly recommend this remarkable piece of "Art" for anyone interested in thought-provoking independent cinema.
