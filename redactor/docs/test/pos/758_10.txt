I was unsure what to expect from "driving lessons"- unsure whether ****** ***** could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. ***** Walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress ****, and ****** *****, equally as good,gave a fantastic performance as the romantic ***.<br /><br />Right from the beginning, I was forced into involuntary cringes, bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as *** broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, ****. A very controversial story, probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time.<br /><br />Highly recommend to anyone seeking a good British film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself.
