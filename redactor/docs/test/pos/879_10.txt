An excellent thriller of all time. ***** Anand excels as ******** and ******. Performances by *** *****, Vyjayantimala, ****** and ***** ***** prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail. ************** adds to the mystery, glamour and other requirements of the story as it evolves. And to top it all, music by ****** *** ****** is unforgettable. "Yeh dil na hota bechara" by ******* *****, "Raat akeli hai" by **** ******, "Rula ke gaya sapna mera" by ****, "****** ke niche" by **** and **** and "****** pe aisi baat main" by ****, again reaffirm ****** ****'s unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own.
