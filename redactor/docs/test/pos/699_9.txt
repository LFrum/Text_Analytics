***** **** is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner ***** ******** to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot. With Ford a no-show, the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice, leaving Ford on the hook for killings he didn't commit.<br /><br />Columbia ********' first color feature, The Desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the Technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectacle.<br /><br />This has the irresistible teaming of a young ***** **** (third-billed but essentially the star) and a prime ******** ***** leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles, including scene-stealer ***** ******** as a good-natured but mildly villainous yokel who isn't as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable lines.<br /><br />A fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama, and comedy, well directed by ******* *****. This is one of the great westerns of the nineteen-forties and highly recommended.
