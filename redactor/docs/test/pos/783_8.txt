A British twist on Harold and *****, ******* ******* features a reined-in ****** ***** and an over-the-top ***** *******. While it is true that ***** is stone-faced like a redheaded ******** ******** for the first half of the movie, it does not deter from the quirky family film--there are things going on that are out of his character's experience that would create a shell-shocked reaction. The chemistry between Walters and ***** carries the film, though ***** ******'s hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable. These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like ****** *******, **** ******** and ***** ******* make this kids popcorn flick worth a Saturday afternoon.
