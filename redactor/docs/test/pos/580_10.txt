This is a movie that will brighten up your day, for sure. ****** the Frog, is just an ordinary frog in his swamp, when a talent agent stops by and tells him that ********* is looking for frogs to be in movie (lol). On the way, ****** meets ****** ****, **** *****, ***** and his chicken *******, *****, The Electric Mayhem, ****** ******** and Beaker. But also trailing ****** is the proprietor of a restaurant chain, *** ******* ****** Fried Frog Legs. All things considered though, ****** and the ******s make it to *********.<br /><br />This movie is recommended for everyone, young and old.<br /><br />It has some wonderful musical numbers, like "The ******* **********, "I'm Going to go Back There Someday," and "*****' ***** *****." The ******s also use many forms of transportation in this movie. ****** rides a bike, ****** drives a Studebaker, and another car, ***** takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons, (which is one of my favorite moments by the way ;) ), and ****** and the rest of the ******s finally go the rest of the way by the Electric Mayhem's bus (Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Janice, *******, and Animal); who meet up with them in the desert after ******'s car breaks down.<br /><br />Even some Sesame Street ******s make cameo appearances (i.e. Big Bird is walking along on the road, on the way to NYC to break into public television). The end is also a very heartwarming moment. Every single ****** created is in the final scene, along with a final "******* **********" reprise.<br /><br />But those poor ******s worked so hard on their movie set, then it all comes crashing down, and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks. You'd think everything is ruined and destroyed, But the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end, and it all sums up the magic of this film, and you know everything will be all right.<br /><br />Perfect 10/10. Watch it, and you'll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie.
