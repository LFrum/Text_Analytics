The subject is World War II and ****** **** is a rejected soldier whom ****** hires as handyman. She is a war widow.<br /><br />The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. ****** **** is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. At first ****** tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and *** ******* as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong. We keep thinking she will be helped, then ****'s personality turns again. He becomes like a Jekyll/Hyde character and eventually chases ****** with a knife.<br /><br />Worth watching for these two superb actors. 9/10.
