If you have seen the Telugu version of ***** "Okkadu" you will find this to be very similar in story line, but ***** has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not ***** pradesh. Although this is a remake of "Okkadu" you will find that ***** and ****** make this a unique film, ***** and ****** make a great pair. A few negatives were when ****** character slaps ******* character for going to buy a present for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end. Good action and songs make this an all around great movie I recommend it.<br /><br />I give it a 10/10, one of the best I have seen.
