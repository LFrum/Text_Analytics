Excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife Gerda (Claire Price) as well, of course, as ***** ******. I did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point. The ending, which I won't divulge (someone describes it on the Board in answer to someone else's question if you are interested.) I found really sad. Despite ****** ********'s reputation for writing cardboard characters, I thought these really well-rounded by and large.<br /><br />The pacing of the story was good and I enjoyed seeing ***** ***** as **** and ****** ********* (******'s son I believe in addition to being a well-known Dr. Watson.)) as her husband.
