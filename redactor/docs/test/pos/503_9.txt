For a brief moment. The opening scene with ***** ***** and the<br /><br />techno bar is incredible. I'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie of all time but with a twist. The fight scenes are awesome. ****** Snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day. And ******* ***** is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary. Great flick 9/10. Where's ***** **?
