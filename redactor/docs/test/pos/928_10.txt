In the "goofs" section for this film there's a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where *******'s car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene. This is incorrect. One of the views is from *******'s flat, the other is from *********'s flat across the street. The whole purpose of this segment is to show how ********* and ******* - who may be made for each other - almost cross paths (as happens several other times) but never quite do so, until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film. (And here there is the implication that ****** has manipulated things so that ******* is on that ferry, having inspected *********'s ticket to see which sailing she is booked on.)
