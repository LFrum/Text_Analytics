Darling **** is fantastic! Its by far one my favorite films! It certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received. ***** *******, playing the title role of **** ***** (Schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie. She is entrancing and spectacular! As ***** ******* is my most favorite actress and singer by far, I was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is. This movie is just...great (I'm running out of adjectives!), it's magnificent, marvellous, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad, and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to **** ***** *******!And to her husband, director ***** *******. Oh, yeah **** ****** was ok, too :)<br /><br />***** ******* is the beautiful and well-loved singer, **** *****. **** ****** portrays ***** *******, who quickly falls for ****, and she with him. But their affair was not coincedental. There meeting was planned by the German Government (I'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them, but you get the point), because the warm, happy, singing entertainer **** is actually a German Spy. **** is told to seduce ***** ******* in order to get information of the new Top Secret Opertaion (later know as "***** *******"). Though **** is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with **** (***** *******), for real, making her original quest challenging. But **** pulls through and completes er task, after she finds out something that is not really true about ****. The ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out. If anything, you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie, I most certainly did!!!!!!!!<br /><br />
