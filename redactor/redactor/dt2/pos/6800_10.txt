In my opinion, National ██████ is one of the top family classic's of all time. It features ██████ ██████ as (Mi Taylor) and █████████ ██████ as (██████ █████).<br /><br />██████ wins a race horse, named (███) in a raffle. She falls in love with it right away. With the help of Mi, an ex-jockey, they train it to race in the Grand National's. After the jockey who was scheduled to race ███ backs out at the last moment, Mi convinces ██████ to take his place.<br /><br />This was a well put together motion picture. Fine storyline and top notch acting. The inner play between █████████ and ██████ was magical. This is a wonderful family picture expertly Directed by ████████ █████. The photography is stunning. This is a movie you will enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />This picture is what made █████████ ██████ a household name. Both ██████ and █████████ remained close after the film. They still send post cards to each other after all these many years. <br /><br />One side note. █████████ loved the horse "███" so much that the studio gave it to her.
