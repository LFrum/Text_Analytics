I was lucky enough to see this at this years ███████ film festival. I was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was. ████████ ███████ █████ has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly. The main story involves the family and it is very thought-provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, yet still has that commercial edge - an "indie" movie for the masses if you like. The performances by the cast are all excellent but it is █████ ████ who shines the brightest. █████ ████ is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be █████ nominated. Early days I know, but ████ acts her socks off here.
