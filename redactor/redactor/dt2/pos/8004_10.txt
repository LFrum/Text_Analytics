I don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. I really don't. ████ -yes, bizarre - no. It i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the ███████'s story. They say it has elements of S&M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for ████████'s whip.<br /><br />This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. ████████ (a great performance by ████████ ███████!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and ███████... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by █████ ██████). Again, I think ███████ ██████ is the best ██████ and he carries his costume well.<br /><br />You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.
