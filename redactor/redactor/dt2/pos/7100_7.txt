This film marked the end of the "serious" █████████ ████████ era (██████ and ████████ meet up with the monsters later in "██████ and ████████ ████ █████████████"). It was a somewhat desparate, yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the Wolf Man, ████████████'s monster, and ███████ one "last" time.<br /><br />I say desparate, because in the previous film, "House of ████████████," both ███████ and the Wolf Man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (███████ by the sunlight, and the wolf man by a silver bullet). Yet somehow they return in House of ███████ with no explanation. This movie could have played as a kind of prequel to House of ████████████ if the ████████████ monster plot wouldn't be continuing chronologically into House of ███████ from House of ████████████, and if the wolf man didn't get cured. Then there'd be no plot holes. But since this is not the case, the plots of ███████ and the Wolf Man make no sense.<br /><br />However, ignoring these plot holes, House of ███████ is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch. It has many high points. Especially seeing the wolf man get cured. I know I just said that this shouldn't have been included, but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time. And the scene with the lady playing "█████████ ██████," on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under ███████'s spell was very eerie. Dr. ███████'s transformation into the "Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde" type character was also done very well.<br /><br />And it's great to see ███████, ████████████, and the Wolf Man together, one "last" time.<br /><br />*** out of ****
