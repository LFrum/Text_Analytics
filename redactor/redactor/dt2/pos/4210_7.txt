This is breezy highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast. Garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with that motley crew the Dead End Kids. Most notable of these is the beautiful █████ █████ who has some very moving moments. Gloria ███████, who in real life died very young in a house fire, is strong and very attractive as █████'s sister, and in the early scenes ███ ████████, on the brink of stardom, is a knock-out. May ██████ is very funny as a crusty old granny, but ██████ █████ proves here that even a great actor can flounder if mis-cast (whoever thought of casting him as a tough New York cop?).<br /><br />Busby ████████ proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers. The film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed. The ending is contrived, and the plot nothing startling or original, but I still found this a highly enjoyable experience.
