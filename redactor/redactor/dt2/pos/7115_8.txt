This moody, creepy horror flick begins on a castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea, a great setting, as a vampire bat flies in and creeps toward a sleeping doctor (██████ ███████). The bat changes into a man known as █████ █████, in reality █████ ███████ (████ █████████). He seeks Dr. ████████'s help to cure him of his vampirism. Eventually the good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked nurse-assistant (████ █████), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney), and ████████████'s monster (█████ ███████). But ███████'s trickery contaminates the doctor's blood, and he becomes a Jekyll/Hyde vampire himself. This is somewhat better than the prior year's "House of ████████████", being less episodic and more exciting visually. There's a haunting scene where ███████ tries to lure the second nurse (██████ O'Driscoll) into his world, where she is initially playing "█████████ ██████" on the piano, which soon gives way to terrifying music. ████████ ████ ██████ uses expressionistic shadows and eerie music to frame many sequences, including a wonderful montage sequence that the studio frequently used in their horror features. Two performers are of note: ███████, with his wonderful voice, is at first sympathetic, then convincingly menacing. █████, her beautiful face in alarming contrast to her twisted body, exhibits great pathos and sympathy. It all ends in a slam-bang climax, typical of 1940s Universal horror, a little abrupt, with footage borrowed from "The Ghost of ████████████" (1942). I hope Universal releases it soon on DVD (it was left out of their Double-Feature releases).
