█████ Egos do not come funnier than the creation of █████ █████ █████'s ███ ██ ██████████ misled by his delusional and non-existent sense of the Middle England Suburban surroundings that his social background consists of. He persists on living the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his Gran in the London suburb of ███████, he keeps tight control of his Posse, the West ███████ "██████".<br /><br />Spending his spare time between Me Julie, his girl, the Posse and teaching local eight year old Scouts at "Keep it Real (advanced)" lessons at the Government funded ████ ████ ███████ Centre.<br /><br />This is where the story takes off, being told that the Government funding has stopped, ███ █ then proceeds on a one-man quest "In the struggle for Justice I iz willing to lay down me Life, just like ██████ ██████ ███ █████ did". Being his reply to the local media crew when interviewing him on hunger strike while chained to a fence.<br /><br />███████ █████ here plays █████ ███████, the sinister and devious Deputy Prime Minster, who is "Even more eviller than Skeletor". Using ███ █, unknowingly, to lose the Prime Minster 18,000 votes three weeks before the General Election. Seeing ███ █ as a bumbling idiot, his plan backfires. ███ █ suddenly becomes an over night sensation and a saviour of the people, working directly with the Prime Minster. The story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences.<br /><br />███ █ Indahouse is a great British movie that brings the hugely talented attributes of writing, along with ███ █████, executive production and acting of █████ █████ █████. ███████ █████ and ███████ ██████, as the P.M. play their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is ███ █ █<br /><br />Ironically, seeing the parodies playing their parts in a World that really is real, and who are continually preaching "Keep it Real" from their own little World that is the West ███████ "██████" is true comic paradox.<br /><br />Directed by ████ █████, his first full length feature film since directing television work such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and the Smell of Reeves and Mortimer to name a few.<br /><br />Very Real and very funny.
