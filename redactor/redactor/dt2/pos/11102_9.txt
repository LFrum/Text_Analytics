This movie does an excellent job of taking us all the way through the dark tunnel of espionage, from the inception through the ultimate reckoning. The movie's impact is made even deeper with the realization that it is based on a true story. ███████ ██████ provides us with a quality, understated performance and ████ ████ demonstrates why he is one of America's finest living actors. As with "████████ ███████," this movie should make us all think twice about doing something we shouldn't be doing in a foreign country.
