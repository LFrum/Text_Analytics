█████ █████'s roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting, but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous (and some would say infamous) General ██████, that follows his career from his first day at West Point, through the Civil War and out west to the battle at The Little Big Horn, all the while butting heads with rival ██████ ███████ and romancing pretty Olivia de Havilland.<br /><br />Some might say that █████, who delivers a great, flamboyant performance as the general, is basically playing himself playing ██████!<br /><br />A lavish production (that should have been in Technicolor) well directed by █████ █████, They Died With █████ █████ On features some truly well-staged battle sequences. Also, it's a real treat to see ███████ █████ playing █████ Horse.<br /><br />The previous year, █████ played ███ ██████ opposite ██████ ██████'s ██████ ██████ in Santa Fe Trail (also with de Havilland), another action-packed Warner Brothers production designed to make you fail history class!
