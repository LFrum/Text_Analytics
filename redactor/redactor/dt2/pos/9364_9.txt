█████████ is one of those films from the Forties that is crying for a remake, if for no other reason than maybe it's time it should be done as originally written. The story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days of post World War II with the holocaust fresh in everyone's mind.<br /><br />In the Lee Server biography of ██████ ███████, ██████ ███████ the director was interviewed and and bluntly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with The Code firmly in place. It could have been though because the character of ██████ ████ is such an equal opportunity hater of everything that deviates from his societal norms.<br /><br />███████ was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the ride. ██████ █████ was cast as the Washington, DC Police homicide captain who catches the case and while ███████ was second billed, he knew from the beginning the film would belong to ████. But he was RKO's new star by dint of his performances in The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End Of Time so he was there for box office insurance. ███████'s part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, ██████ Cooper.<br /><br />█████████ is not a whodunit, even though we don't see the crime it becomes clear that ██████████ is the one who kills ███ ██████, the quintessential Jewish salesperson. And it becomes clear to █████ and ███████ that ████ is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience. It becomes just a question of getting the evidence.<br /><br />████ earned one of several ███████ █████ nominations the film garnered, his Best Supporting █████ category. Though he lost to ██████ █████, the film was ████'s breakthrough role. Similarly ██████ ███████ was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for ████ ██████████ ███████, but she lost to ███████ ████ for █████████'s Agreement. In fact █████████ ran up against █████████'s Agreement and lost for ████ ███████ and Best director for ███████ to ████ █████. It's fifth nomination for ████ ██████████ and █████████ came up short again with the winner being ███████ on 34th Street.<br /><br />██████ ███████ also had her own problems on the set which spilled over from her personal life. She was having big trouble with her then husband ███████ ████████ who was an abusive husband. He was hanging around the set causing ██ ███████ a lot of problems. Fortunately ███████'s part was a small one. In fact the whole film was shot in typical RKO economy style in 20 days.<br /><br />██████ █████ has a particularly fine scene with ███████ ██████ a young kid from Tennessee in ███████ and ████'s outfit who ████ constantly belittles. █████ is most eloquent in speaking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected his family as Irish Catholics who came over in the potato famine years. It was one of ██████ █████'s best moments on screen in his long career.<br /><br />As fine a film as █████████ is, it's time to be remade as a story about an anti-gay hate crime. Especially with the real killing of █████ ████████ from the last decade and the debate about gays in the military.<br /><br />That's a film who's time has come and almost gone.
