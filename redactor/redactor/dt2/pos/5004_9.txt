I saw it last week and the sketch about the Korea towns was funny . Very tongue in cheek and suitable to the political climate. Full points to the writers and █████ for that. The part where he makes the translator pull a rickshaw and throws out Korean words could have been pulled off only by █████. This is a brave attempt by ███ . This is a brilliant show and I hope that it pulls off . My wife and I have been TIVOing it regularly and although it clashes it with a couple of other programs we watch it now on MySpace. I hope ███ dedicates full resources to the show and makes it daily. I can't wait to see █████ ███ on his show . With people like ███████ ████████ behind the show this is on the right track. Also ████ ███ as his wife looks beautiful.
