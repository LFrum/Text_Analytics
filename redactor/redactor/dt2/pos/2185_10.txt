██████ █████ really went all out and over the top which in this case was great. I've heard the Len Cariou version but it was too tame. ██████ was great in that character - very expressive.<br /><br />██████ ████████ was perfect for the part. She gave a great performance. She gave the Mrs. Lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story.<br /><br />I love the dark humor when ██████ ████████ sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of ██████ █████ in his songs of rage, vengeance and distress.<br /><br />I've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it in 1985 on my own)when it came out in 1990 and I definitely bought a copy of the DVD when it came out in 2004.
