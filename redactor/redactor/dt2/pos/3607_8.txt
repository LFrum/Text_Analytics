Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of ███████ ████'s better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. ████ Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by ████████ ████, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows ████ to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it. Again, ███████ ████ did not disappoint.
