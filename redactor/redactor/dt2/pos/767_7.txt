███ Marshall, a teen ager from a religious background, is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother █████. She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household. In fact the family has taken a widower, to board with them. ██████ ████████, the father, is a pastor at the local church; he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church.<br /><br />The job ███ applies is with an older actress, ████ ██████, who wants him to do things for her around the house. "Dame" ████, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great. In fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but she'd rather forget about it. ████, who is a compulsive liar, tells ███ she's dying, only to forget it conveniently, later on when she comes clean to the boy. <br /><br />███ is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of his employer. He has been taking driving lessons. ████ asks him to take a camping trip, which he does against his better judgment. He knows that it will provoke his mother's fury. Not content with that, ████ decides to go on to Edinburgh, where she has been invited to read at an arts festival. It is this trip that solidifies their bond. ███ gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic Bryony.<br /><br />When ███ gets back, everything crumbles at home. His mother, who has been having an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with. ███ and ████'s relationship survives the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in a different light. <br /><br />██████ █████, the writer of "Driving Lessons" and other memorable English films, takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy. The mixture of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship, are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies. We have seen the similar situation before as in "█████ ███████", where █████ ███████ plays a nurturing role with a younger man. We had read the film was based on ███ █████'s own experience while working ████ █████ ████████ when he was young. <br /><br />█████ ███████, who plays ████ ██████, is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. She always delivers. Ms. Walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake "dame". █████ Linney, a luminous player herself, doesn't quite get our sympathy with her icy mother. ██████ Grint, famous for his █████ ██████'s movies plays ███, the young man who sees in ████ a kind soul. ████████ Farrell is the betrayed father. ████████ Duncan has a small role in which she shines.
