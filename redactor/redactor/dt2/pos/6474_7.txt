Recently was traveling in Norway from Bergen, Norway and stopped in the small town of Voss, Norway and there was a monument in honor of █████ ██████ who was born in Voss years ago. The people all know about █████ to this day and tour guides are proud to stop at his monument. This film is a great history of this great man and his great love for █████ ████ █████ realized that █████ has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time coached the football team. ██████ ██████ played the role of ██████ ████, (The Gipper) who was an outstanding football player; ██████ had a short role, but gave a great supporting role in this film. ██████ Crisp, (██████ ████ ████████) was outstanding as a priest who always had great faith in █████ during his entire life at Notre Dame. This is a great Classic film and will be viewed by many generations to come. Enjoy.
