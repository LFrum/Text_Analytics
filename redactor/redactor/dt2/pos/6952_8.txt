███████ County, Vermont, 1927. ████ Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian mate, Bangor (██████ ████████) in the area where a large dam is to be built; ████, however, is not willing to give up on his land, and he'll have to fight the dam company in order to prevent the County from any possible destruction.<br /><br />"Where the Rivers Flow North" is a gripping, contemplative story powered by the memorable performances of Rip Torn (recently seen in the small but juicy role of █████ ██ in Sofia Coppola's underrated "█████ ██████████") and ██████ ████████ ("Dances With Wolves", "█████ ███████"). ████████ ███ ██████ (who also co-wrote the script with ███ ██████, based on ██████ █████ ██████'s novel) and cinematographer ████ ████ crafted this powerful story with unique, contemplative pace/visuals, which remind me of Terrence Malick's and ████ ██████'s best moments. It's an underrated independent period piece of the first (electric) half of the 90's, usually regarded as the rise of ███████ █████████'s burlesque ("████ ███████" is a masterpiece indeed, but the man suffers from █████ ██████' Syndrome), ████ ███████'s disturbing suburbia, █████ █████'s dark vision of the UK (let's not mention that "Beach" flick with DiCaprio, though)... ███ ██████ should be more regarded on the lists of great indie filmmakers as well. He's been leading a respectful, discreet career and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his.<br /><br />My vote: 8/10.
