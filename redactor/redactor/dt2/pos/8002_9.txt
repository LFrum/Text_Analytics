I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. I've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action ██████ films to date (and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again). I'm also starting to become concerned about whether I'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian. You see, I always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two ███ ██████ directed films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first ██████ ██████ this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might, I just couldn't help feel that ██████ ███████ just has too many small direction, plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.<br /><br />But ██████ _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style, and even though there are a lot of small flaws, ██████ ███████ is still a great film, especially if you're a ██████ fan, as ██████ ███████ has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and ██████ ████████████ (1990) as it does with anything else in the ██████ universe.<br /><br />The film begins strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the ██████ ████ River. The baby ends up becoming ██████ villain The Penguin (█████ ██████).<br /><br />Meanwhile, ███ ██████ (███████████ ██████) is the film's "evil capitalist", comparable to ███████ (████ ███████) in ██████. He is planning on duping ██████ ████ in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid ██████ ████ (Michelle Pfeiffer). When ████ discovers one of the nefarious plots, ███████ tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming ████████.<br /><br />While all of this is going on, The Penguin, who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, ulterior motives.<br /><br />Before re-watching ██████'s ██████ films this time, I didn't remember just how little the films are about ██████ (███████ ██████). It's almost as if ██████ didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially The Penguin. ██████ doesn't appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we're watching him watching The Penguin.<br /><br />Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, I can't say that I do, even if I'd like to know more about ██████ and follow his story more. The villains' stories are interesting, too, and as an "origin story" for two major ██████ villains, ██████ ███████ is already more than complex in terms of plot.<br /><br />However, there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding, but even though they're frequently on screen, we never get to learn anything about them. ██████ has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use them.<br /><br />For that matter, he hardly has space to explore ████████. The film plays as if ████████ may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin, but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. So the bulk of the ████████ scenes had to be excised. Of course, all of this barely leaves any room for ██████. ██████ has ██████ turn very dark in the public's eye in this film, and unusually, he never bothers to resolve this. As far as we know, at the end, Gothamites still think that ██████ is a murdering lunatic. That's an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.<br /><br />As for the script, although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it's clear that ██████ and writers ███ ████ and ██████ ██████ are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented, but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course, sometimes it is very blatant or transparent, too). It helps to look at ██████ ███████ as a more "poetic" film, as I believe was the intention. This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions, including from minor characters, are done in service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well.<br /><br />"████" is the easiest way to sum up ██████ ███████ in a word, and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark. So for me, ██████'s style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways, ██████ ███████ is like an insane, campy horror film, with beautifully eerie production design. Like ██████, ██████ is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and ████ ████ (1977) (well, there's still a slight ████ ████ reference), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that "███ ███████" was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there), █████ ████ (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, █████ █████ and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin's final scene.<br /><br />In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general "feel" of the story, the characters and so on--this couldn't be a stronger 10.
