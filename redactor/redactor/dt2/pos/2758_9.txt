████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x, isn't much different at all from the previous games (excluding ████ ████ 3). The only thing new that is featured in ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x, is the new selection of levels, and tweaked out graphics. ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x offers a new career mode, and that is the 2x career. The 2x career is basically ████ ████ 1 career, because there is only about five challenges per level. If you missed ████ ████ 1 and 2, I suggest that you buy ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x, but if you have played the first two games, you should still try this one. Overall, there really isn't anything new, but it is still very fun to go through the game. Hopefully this review benefits your needs.<br /><br />Graphics: 7 out of 10 Overall, the clean visuals isn't really one of ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x's main characteristics. The atmosphere has been changed around a lot from ████ ████ 1 and 2, and the character models look a little bit improved. When you look back to ████ ████'s Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, the thought that those old graphics are ugly run through your head. In ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are rendered A LOT better. The character models are no longer filled with jaggys, the textures are more smooth, but not to the farthest extent. ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x's visuals do not compare to ████ ████ 3's graphics, but ██████████ probably didn't want to make ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x have extraordinary graphics. Overall, the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put the full power of the Xbox to use in here. Graphics are nice, and clean, that's all I have to say.<br /><br />Sound: 8 out of 10 The sound effects don't deliver much to the imagination, but the skateboards popping off of the ground sound great. The main reason why I gave the sound factor a rating, was because you are not obligated to listen to the below average ████ ████ soundtrack, because there is a custom soundtrack feature. The sound effects sound a lot better than the sounds in ████ ████ 1 and 2, mainly because it is more clearer, and just the fact that everything sounds great. One of the main reasons why I bought this game, is because of the custom soundtrack. The grind sound effects still sound the same as the first two games did, just a little tweaked out. One of the major problems of the sound factor, is the fact that if the song is over, it will NOT proceed to the next track, the song that you have just listened to will just play over again. I don't like the in-game soundtrack, but like I said, you are not obligated to listen to it.<br /><br />Controls: 10 out of 10 The controls are the best part of ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x. The control set-up is marvelously comfortable, and easy to get used to. Back in the Playstation days, people thought that the controls were the best ever, but it looks like 2x has done a better job with the Xbox control. Surprisingly, it is very easy to use the control stick to execute tricks. ██████████ has done great work with ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x's controls. They have made the Xbox controller the best for ████ ████ games. You will not be disappointed with the control style, and that is a guarantee.<br /><br />Game play: 10 out of 10 Excluding the fact that ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x is basically ████ ████ 1 and 2 put together, the game play is still unbelievably fun. The game play factor has been changed around a bit. This time, you get A LOT more air than in the first two games, and it is a lot easier to perform tricks. In ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career modes, consisting of ████ ████ 1 career, ████ ████ 2 career, and the 2x career. ████ ████ 1 career is rather easy because in the first game, you get NOTHING for air. The ████ ████ 2 career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the playstation version did. The only amount of difficulty that applies to the 2x career, is finding out where all items are, but after you've done that, 2x career is no hard at all. In the 2x career, there is a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes, collecting S-K-A-T-E, and doing whatever else is required for that particular level. The third level out of the three, is the competition level, where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold. In the first two levels, the secret tapes, and collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, are featured in both of them. Overall, ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x still maintains the old ████ ████'s Pro Skater vibe.<br /><br />Story: -<br /><br />Fun factor: 10 out of 10 ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x is by far, the most funnest game on Xbox today. I have played ████ ████'s Pro Skater 1 and 2, and back then, I didn't like them, but for some reason, ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x is really fun. There really isn't much to say, except that ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x is by far, the best game on Xbox today. One problem, is that if you've already gone through the game once, you will play it a couple more times, but it will be repetitive.<br /><br />Replay value: 10 out of 10 ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x delivers a high amount of replay value. There is a lot of cheats to unlock, and a lot of character videos. Overall, ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x has lots of replay value, mainly because it is so fun.<br /><br />Best feature: You are not obligated to listen to the crappy in-game soundtrack. Worst feature: The custom soundtrack is a bit messed up.<br /><br />Final Statement: Lots of people have complained in the past that they didn't like ████ ████'s Pro Skater 2x because there is nothing new, but they should stop complaining because your getting a lot of game for $50.00.<br /><br />Graphics: 7 out of 10.
