Someone once defined what is the definition of AN INTELLECTUAL as being: "A person who can listen to "The ███████ ████ ████████" without thinking of the LONE RANGER!" In this, we heartily concur! It surely would be a tall order to accomplish this, and one that ███████ █████████, ██████ █████████ or .Leonard █████████ would all find nigh well impossible to do.<br /><br />And in this there is no disgrace. The Radio Series and the Television Series, along with some Movie Serials, ███████ █████, Syndicated Newspaper Comic Strip and Comic Books, all did their part to make "the Masked Man of the Plains and his Faithful Indian companion, █████" a deeply seeded element of our collective psyche and of our literary folklore.<br /><br />As with most legends, it all started gradually, first with a series of █████ █████, written for local use in Detroit over █████ ███████ WXYZ. The Creator was one ██████ ██ ███████ and the Principal Writer on the Series was ███ ███████'s brother-in-law, ███ ████ ███████. The year was 1933 when the Ranger first rode out to "the Plains of the Early Western United States!" The Lone Ranger, █████ and the Radio Series all successfully guided Depression Era Americans through the mid and late '30's up to and through World War II. But the Post-War Era found the country in the midst of a Super-Nova Explosion of invention and technology. There had been a new communications medium standing ready in the wings, but unable to go forth until both VE Day and VJ Day had been achieved. Once these were accomplished and the World and America was ready to settle down to both Peace and Prosperity. The "New Technology" was, of course was TELEVISION! And we would surely need something else than "██████ █████" and "Wrestling ████ ████████ █████" to fill up the broadcast hours. And while at first, the time that a TV ███████ had anything on, except that portrait of that ███████ █████ (Test Pattern, ███████!) Very soon and with post haste, the Networks began tapping their existing Natural Resources, their existing programming! Virtually all would be ripe for adaptation to the TV Screen.<br /><br />So, the folks over at Lone Ranger, ████████████ were very interested when Producers Jack Chertok, █████ █████, ███████ ██████ and ████ ███████ all approached them with a deal to put The Masked Man and █████ on the Television waves, as well as the Radio.<br /><br />Immediately they went to work and gave us the first season, which made use of the considerable back log of █████ ██████, all potentially adaptable to TV dramas. They cast ███████ █████, a fine supporting actor in many a feature film, and with about a dozen years experience. He also had done some work in Serials over at Republic Pictures' "██████ ███████", which would be invaluable experience in doing "THE LONE RANGER". Cast as his "faithful Indian companion" and partner in bringing Justice to various parts of the Frontier, we had sheer perfection in character-supporting Actor, ███ ███████████.** We must mention that there was that rift in about '53, when ███████ █████ walked and was replaced with ████ ████. After a season or so, ███ █████ was back in-having been missed so much! Now, ████ to Our Story!! The first years of filming gave the episodes a look and a sound all of their own. They made good use of off screen Narrator, which gave these shows a feel of authenticity and an individual, stand-out one of a kind series. The actors employed were all veterans of the movies of the late silent era thru the 1930's and 1940's. A lot of them had been just about exclusively "██████ █████" players. A good example of these is the casting of █████ ███████ (Bartender Sam on "GUNSMOKE") as the vicious, murderous ████ ██████, █████ █████████. And it was the Cavendish Gang's massacre of the Texas Rangers that led to the origin of ████ ████ (thought to have been slain with the other Texas Rangers) as the "LONE RANGER".<br /><br />In addition to the old timers in the cast, you will find a lot of new and up and coming talent (then) in the cast. We see people like ███████ ██████, ██████ ███████, ██████ ████ and others in the cast from week to week. All of this, along with an always calling for fair-play, justice and peace in a western world.<br /><br />The last couple of seasons brought some big changes. █████ was the use of Colour Filming. That made no difference as a Colour TV ███ was still a long way off for our household. The second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (Other than ███████'s Finale from "U NO Wutt!") The new music was never a big deal to us, as we preferred the "old Radio" stock stuff.<br /><br />With this series and two ███████ █████ done during this period, THE LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (United Artists, 1958), the character has been permanently and indelibly impressed in our identity as a People, we Americans!
