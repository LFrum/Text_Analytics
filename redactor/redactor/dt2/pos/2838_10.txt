After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, █████ █████ is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. ████████ ████ ██████ proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). █████ █████████ gives the best performance of her career as █████, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay █████ ███████), and gets lost in a fantasy world. ██████ ███████ and █████ ████ play the hitmen who killed her husband and are now on her trial. The trick to the film is that ███████ and █████████ are really parallel characters. While █████████ falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite Dr. ████ ██████ on a soap opera, ███████ idealizes █████. █████ █████ is a brillant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My Grade: 10/10.
