██████ ████, in 1969, was best known for playing in television comedy shows - in particular ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where she was the giggly cookie young blond. She did make movies before CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable being a Walt Disney feature, THE ONE AND ONLY GENUINE, ORIGINAL FAMILY BAND. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up on her character from LAUGH-IN, and (due to a good script by I.A.L. Diamond - █████ ██████'s second partner - based on an Abe Burrows play) she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out. As a result Ms ████ won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and her career took off to such future hits as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other stars of LAUGH-IN did well on television (█████ ██████ has a recurring role as a judge on BOSTON LEGAL) only ██████ was able to have a career as a bonifide movie star.<br /><br />On LAUGH-IN ██████'s personality would show a naiveté that would be embarrassing. Occasionally she realized it, and would laugh loud to cover, but sometimes she just did not see her error (example: ██████ is introduced to the 1950s variety show host ████ █████, and is told, "██████, this is ███ ████ █████." She shakes his hand and says (much to his confusion), "I've always wanted to meet ███ ████ ████ █████!"). But as ████ ███████ it is quite different. She is desperately in love with Dr. ██████ ███████ (██████ ███████), a successful dentist, who can never marry her. ██████ has told her that his wife (with whom he has had two sons and a daughter) will never give him a divorce. So at the start of the film ████ tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove. But she is rescued by her neighbor, ████ ████████ (████ ████), a struggling dramatist, who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas. <br /><br />████ is resigned to live, but she has sent a suicide note to ██████. ████ tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but ██████'s receptionist/nurse/assistant, █████████ █████████ (Ingrid ███████) won't stop ██████'s work schedule to pass him the phone when ████ calls. Instead ██████ finds the letter and races to ████'s apartment, only to find her alive. When ████ supports her story that she tried to kill herself, ██████ realizes the depth of her love, and decides he must marry such a woman. Unfortunately ████ has swallowed ██████'s lies, and believes in his wife and children. You see, ██████ has no wife and children. Since ████ is a firm believer that she can't marry a man who would lie to her ██████ is stuck on a weakening tree branch.<br /><br />██████ comes to solve it by getting █████████ to pretend she is Mrs. Winston. █████████ is opposed to it at first, but on her own, on her first free Saturday, she confronts ████ at the record shop ████ is at. They talk, and ████ notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of █████████ (and since █████████ has her two nephews with her, ████ thinks they are ██████'s kids). ████ tells ██████ they have to see who is the man that █████████ is supposedly going to marry. So the lie starts spiraling for ██████, █████████, and ████. Soon a lover is given to █████████ in the form of ██████'s friend and freeloading patient ██████ ██████████ (████ ██████). Greenfield is so sleazy (█████████ loathes him) that ████ feels that he is unworthy of █████████.<br /><br />And so it goes, with one complication (most caused by the well-intentioned, misinformed ████) following another until the conclusion. The script is full of first rate situations and one-liners (example: ██████ to reward █████████ for lying about their marriage, buys two record albums from ████'s store. He has given a mink stole to ████, but she decides to send it to █████████ with ██████'s card. █████████ is quite happy at getting the mink, but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got - when she profusely thanks ███████, he says the thought she'd like ████████ - meaning ████████ ████████. But █████████ thinks ████████ is the name of the furrier!). <br /><br />███████ must have enjoyed the filming, as several scenes shows that earthy radiance that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films. But there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit, INDISCREET. There Cary █████ lied to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage. When █████'s lie is revealed to ███████ she decides on a lie of her own to convince █████ that she was making him a cuckold. Here, instead of being the passive lover believing ███████ is telling the truth, ███████ gingerly tries to get ███████ out of his mess by little white lies, only to find one leads to another to complicate everyone's lives. ███████ is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem, despite trying to be part of the solution.<br /><br />All the leads perform well, in particular ███████, all business thoroughness at first but gradually reclaiming her sexuality. ███████ is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that just can't be kicked aside. The supporting cast, especially Weston as the mooching and sexually slimy ██████, and ████ ██████ as the U.N. ambassador who actually has the hots for ███████. It was a clever comedy, and a really good way for ██████ ████'s movie career to push forward.
