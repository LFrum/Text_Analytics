Not having seen this film in quite some time, we caught with it not long ago in the nicely transferred █████████ ███. "Le cercle rouge" is a film that owes a lot to other movies, as it keeps reminding us about "Rififi", "The Asphalt Jungle", among others, because they all deal with capers that take center stage in the movie and reproduce it in great detail. Unfortunately, one knows that old adage that crime does not pay, and from the start, these men involved in it are doomed from the onset.<br /><br />Jean-Pierre ████████ was a director of few words. He didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog, as it's the case here. Yet, for not being "talky", they had a style of their own as proved with "██ ██████", "██ ███████", and his masterpiece, "███ le flambeur", among others. ██ █ ████████ had a sense of style that comes across in everything he did. In this film, working with his cinematographer, █████ █████, he takes us along for a ride through the streets of Paris that shows the vibrant city mainly at night and the bleak winter in France. The score is by ████ ████████ that emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of the action.<br /><br />Although the film shows █████ █████, as █████, at the center of the action, it is however, the smart inspector ██████ who is the real hero of the movie. As played by the great Bourvil, he is a man that shows a lot of patience because he has figured from the beginning how to catch █████, and in the process he gets involved in the investigation of the jewel heist in which he knows the escaped man he is tailing looms large behind it. Bourvil gives an enormously satisfying performance as ██████ showing equal parts of determination and tenderness, as it's the case with the three cats he adores.<br /><br />█████ █████ always responded with interesting performances his appearances in █████████'s pictures. In here he is █████, the man who is first seen leaving prison and promising himself he won't go back, but he cannot pass a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery. His association with █████ and ██████, pays off in the way they get the job done, but it will also prove a mistake in the way they will not be able to dispose of the loot as the fence they have relied on has a change of heart.<br /><br />████ █████ ███████ and Yves Montand are seen as █████ and ██████, respectively. They were excellent actors who blend well in the action of the film. Both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and it shows. ██ █ Montand has the more complex character to play as we witness him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head.<br /><br />Jean-Pierre █████████ got wonderful results from his cast and crew in a film, that although feels a bit longer, but still succeeds in showing his style in one of the most memorable pictures from the director.
