"█████████ ████" is directed by █████ ██ ██████ (Terms of Endearment, As Good As It Gets) and has a great cast, including ███████ ████, ██████ ██████, and █████ ██████. Everyone gives a good performance, but they're all too unlikable to really care about them.<br /><br />Some parts of the film are really brilliant, such as the prologue, and the short scenes with ████ █████████. The main reason it doesn't entirely work, is it's a film that relies on the characters being amusing rather than amusing things happening to them.<br /><br />You could consider it nothing more than a drama, but it's often too silly to be successful there as well. Still, the script makes it worth a watch. Certainly not for everyone.<br /><br />7.0 out of 10
