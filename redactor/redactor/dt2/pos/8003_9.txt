███ ██████ the man behind the original ██████ film and Beetlejuice, brings the world the sequel to ██████, that exceeds the original in more ways than one. Firstly ████████ ████████ and █████ ██ ████ are a great mix of ██████s enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. ███ ██████s direction bring superhero films into a new realm. Beats all the superman films and the other ██████ films by a mile. Though in terms of realisation the new ██████ begins has a bite where this one lacks, but ██████ is a more original director than █████.
