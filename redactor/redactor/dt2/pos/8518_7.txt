1983 was "the battle of the ████s". That year both █████ █████ and ████ ███████ starred in two separate █████ ████ film, the former (Octopussy) was produced by the "official" makers of the ████ films while the later (█████ ███ █████ █████) was produced "unofficially" by a group led by █████ McClory who held the film rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly enough is the "unofficial" film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that █████ ███ █████ █████ is a remake of Thunderball.<br /><br />█████ ███ █████ █████ has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a ████ film. It all starts with ████ ███████, returning to the play ████ for the first time since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. Connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in Diamonds Are Forever. The ████ of █████ ███ █████ █████ is the sleek and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. The one downside to Connery's age is his believability, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. Let's face it even Connery, despite being in top physical shape, looks as odd as █████ when he is bedding women half his age. Yet despite this believability issue, █████ ███ █████ █████ shows Connery in one of his better ████ performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier ████ performances.<br /><br />███ █████████ plays ██████ in one of her early film roles. █████████ plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. █████████ holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. In fact she may well outshine her Thunderball counter-part played by ████████ Auger.<br /><br />Then there's the villain, ██████████ █████ played by █████ █████ █████████. █████████'s █████ is everything a █████ ████ film villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all believable none the less. █████████ makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other ████ villains have fallen into by going over the top. █████████ plays █████ with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007.<br /><br />The excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well. ███████ ███████ makes a fine henchwoman in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears. ███ Von Sydow a nice appearance as ███████, though his appearance is more akin to a cameo. █████ ████████ makes an appearance as ████'s bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film. With all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the MI6 staff from ██████ ███'s M who makes for a great contrast to ███████ ███, ██████ █████ who make s affine ██████████ and the icing on the cake with ████ ███████'s wonderful Q. The supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of ██████ █████ as █████ ██████ and █████ O'Herlihy as ████ ███████ who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a ████ film.<br /><br />On top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients. From the opening Central America sequence to the fight at Shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase, this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part. The film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions, and all the things we expect from a ████ film. █████ ████████, then fresh off doing The Empire Strikes Back, brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles.<br /><br />Yet this film is far from perfect. █████ ███ █████ █████ is easily one of the most dated of the ████ films with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games. While technology dates any film after a time, this film's heavy reliance on it, especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it's a remake of Thunderball.<br /><br />Yet for its predictability the script for █████ ███ █████ █████ is pretty good. The script sports good dialogue scenes, not a single cringe worthy one liner (how many of the █████ █████ era scripts can you say that about?), some humorous situations, and yet is watchable and tense for the most part. Once you look past he fact that it's a remake, there's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film.<br /><br />Music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the "unofficial" status of the film, the █████ ████ Theme could not be used. That said this could have shown with the right composer that a ████ score without it could work. Unfortunately ███████ ███████'s score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is totally out of place in a ████ film and there is only of or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a █████ ████ film.<br /><br />Despite being heavily dated, somewhat predicable, and having a bad score █████ ███ █████ █████ is still a good ████ film. With one of the best casts of any ████ film, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction, and some terrific dialogue, this film proves that "unofficial" isn't a bad thing. In fact it is is better then Octopussy and the winner of "the battle of the ████s".
