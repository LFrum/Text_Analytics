This movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of ████ ████. This is good in one way because the movie has some interesting things to say, but bad in another because everyone who watches it expecting that tough-guy ████ is going to hoop through his usual paces, is going to be mighty disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, ████ is suddenly introduced in the third reel. True, his role is a key one but it's small and likely to get lost in the shuffle. There are many key roles in former newspaperman ██████ ██████'s ambivalent screenplay which hits out at all political alliances and quite ruthlessly denigrates Reform candidates. It's the lovely and extremely talented ████ ████████ who ties the various strands of the wide-ranging story together. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot actually proceeds in a series of jumps, much like the films later turned out by the French "New Wave", though easier to follow here, especially if you are aware that the film's original title was █████ ███████. Nonetheless, some of the film's narrative and character switches are a little disconcerting, particularly in the role played by ████ LaRue who has wisely elected to act the part in a strangely non-committal way. One of ████'s best acting jobs ever, but no-one is likely to notice, alas!
