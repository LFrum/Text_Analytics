████ ████████ was excellent as "███████" in the movie by the same name. I don't think a better portrayal could have been done. The movie was funny, yet touching. ███████ is a very "human angel" (If their is such). █████ MacDowell is superb in her role as a reporter, as she goes from disbelief to belief. ████ Hurt and ██████ ██████████ are great as fellow reporters, each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth. Each of the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the older woman (I do not know her screen name), who plays ███████'s mother! One of the cutest movies I have seen in years... I could watch this movie dozens of times!
