I think every critic who panned "█████ ███" when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all. Every critic panned █████ ██████ and █████ █████'s movies. Yes "Coneheads" was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and "█████ █████" I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made. But "█████ ███" does not fall in the category of "Coneheads" which could have been a little funnier and "█████ █████" which is a piece of tripe. It is very funny and entertaining. I do agree with the critics that █████ ██████ was no ████ ███████ or ████ █████ as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but █████ ██████ was very funny and I wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no ████ ███████, or ████ █████ but he was very funny. The scenes between ██████ and Spade as nemesis are side-splitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious. It is very sad that █████ ██████ is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like "█████ ███" to remember how truly funny he was. "█████ ███" is one of the 1990's best comedies.
