By 1950, ████ ████ had already fully-developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful Westerns. Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the Joad family of █████████'s 'The Grapes of Wrath (1940).' Within these communities, even amid ████'s loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there's always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living. '█████ ██████ (1950)' came after ████ had released the first two films in his "cavalry" trilogy  'Fort ██████ (1948)' and 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)'  and it covers similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damningly, the strong lead of ████ █████. ███ ███████ and █████ ████, Jr. are fine actors, but they feel as though they should be playing second-fiddle to somebody, and ████ ████'s cursing ██████ elder, while potentially a candidate for such a role, isn't given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the bill.<br /><br />In '█████ ██████,' ████ seems so comfortable with his tried-and-tested Western formula that any character development is largely glossed over. ███ ███████'s romance with ██████ ███ is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and █████ ████ ██'s charming of a ██████ girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film, leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes. Only in ███████ ██████'s charismatic and shamelessly-villainous █████ ██████ does ████ try some different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack-jawed yokels. Where ████ does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of Americans  the values-orientated Mormoms, the easygoing horse-traders, the eccentric travelling showmen  into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future. This apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of █████ ██████'s gun-toting outlaws, who exploit the lawlessness of the Western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who "only ever drew on snakes."<br /><br />████ reportedly considered █████ ██████ among the favourite of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like ████ █████ or █████ █████. Armed only with his stock selection of usual players, ████ is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character, though most of the Mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous. Despite being undoubtedly well-made, I can't help feeling that this film only does well what other ████ pictures did even better: the terrific majesty of the the Western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'; the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in 'Fort ██████'; the early relations with Native Americans, only hinted at here, were more thoroughly examined in 'The Searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly (albeit by █████ ████████ and ██████ ████████) in 'How the West Was Won (1962).' '█████ ██████' is pure ████ ████, but it isn't a landmark.
