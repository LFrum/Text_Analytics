"Thriller" is brilliant. It is a long video, but simply brilliant nonetheless. The song itself is...excellent...add ███████ ███████ dancing and you have a golden Phenomenon. Out of all the videos I have ever seen, this is the best. If you have not seen the video yet, then I urge you...<br /><br />The special effects are amazing for it's time... everything from the wearwolf transformation to the idea of these creepy zombies slowly raising from their graves is grand...spookishly grand that is. ██████ Price has his segment of bone-shivering lines...known simply as "the rap" ███ ███ does good as ███████'s girl, and ███████ ███████ himself...the dancing, and singing (although not during the video itself) is unmatched...<br /><br />10/10.
