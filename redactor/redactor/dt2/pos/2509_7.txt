█████ (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, █████ has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. Working at █████'s store are the manager, █████ (█████ █████████), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, ██████ (███ ███████), and two young college students, ████████ (Julianne Nicholson) and ██████ (███ ███████ █████). One day, █████ stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that ██████ has written it for her. Throwing caution to the wind, █████ and ██████ begin a small-time "thing". But, the letter subsequently lands in others' hands, including █████'s, who thinks ██████ has sent it to her, and ██████'s, who imagines █████ has penned it for him. And, on and on the letter goes. But, in truth, ██████ possibly has eyes for █████ and ████████ has fallen hard for ██████. The town's museum curator, too, may have a secret love. Will tangled affairs like these ever straighten themselves out? This is a cute movie with a gorgeous setting and capable stars. Each of the main actors gives a pleasing performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and ██████ ██████ to those mentioned previously. Then, too, the coastal scenery is most lovely, the costumes quite well-chosen, and the photography very nice indeed. There are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development, which may not please all viewers. But, for those who love romantic comedies, this one should be included on any list of good choices for the genre.
