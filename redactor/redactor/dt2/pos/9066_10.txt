Saw this at Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The film is REALLY exceptional. The crowd I went with all loved it. Funny, poignant and great acting. I'm tired of the tried and true Hollywood romances, who can relate? █████ █████████ (███) is really amazing as the sure and true lover of the ultra-screwy █████ (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When ███ falls for █████ we believe it. Why? Because love at first sight IS crazy and we're dealing with two lost, and maybe not so crazy, souls. Also of note are ███████ ████ as ██████ and ███████ ████████ as a sexless/sexy neurotic, both "roommates" of ███ and █████ before they embark on their trip to Sheboygen, WI and finding themselves. Don't miss this one, its something special! P.S. The soundtrack, led by █████ █████ (of ████ █████ ██████ fame) is really super super cool as well.
