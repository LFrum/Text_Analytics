Commissaire ██████(█████ ███████) is a single with a little gun who loves cats and his boss at the Paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty. That is what the film is all about. And a jewel robbery at the place Vendome.<br /><br />█████ (█████) brings the plan from prison, █████(███████)joins him and helps him against two tough guys, who are after him, because he took mafioso █████(█████ █████) money, while ████ already took █████s girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail. █████ and █████ find a third man, ██████(Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made ammunition into a hole. A perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the booty and there is ██████ in the role of a buyer in disguise. The circle closes. Running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving ██████ and his little pistol.<br /><br />It took ████████ 20 years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for RIFFIFI. ████████ wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of France and in Paris of yesteryear. The great █████ █████ is as usual the lighting cameraman. It is the one before last picture of ████████s who died after another film with █████ in 1972.<br /><br />████████ actually wanted ████████ instead of ███████, he didn't like that Italian at all, but ███████-█████ is an excellent fugitive and gives next to Bourvil the most convincing performance. But mind you: ████████ notes, that ███████ is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very wearying and absolutely impossible on a French set. ████████ didn't like him at all and didn't want to work with him ever again.<br /><br />████████ is wrong. ███████ give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters. You can see what he is feeling being chased by ██████ and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of France in winter 70. A wild actor.<br /><br />Also █████ ███████, who passed away close to the time of the filming. He also was not first choice, but definitely a great substitute. He carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more.<br /><br />██████ has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a tripod but risks eventually freehandedly a successful shot. When he meets █████ the first time we already know that the elegant ██████ has a severe drinking problem. After the robbery Montand renounces to take his part of the booty and mentions to █████, who looks up to him, that he only got into the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. █████ doesn't catch what he means. The audience recalls having seen Montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him. At that time a very rare scene, one recalls a long time after. I bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making. Great artwork when art was made by hand.<br /><br />We sure will remember a crew like the actors, still it seems even after 33 years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of ████████. What is wrong with it? I am afraid one doesn't take much interest in those three actors (showing three criminals) and their police hunter. We learn too little about █████ and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl(████ ███████). Montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. █████ acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the samourai, ███████ is the man in the trunk of █████s American car and superbly moving and ██████ is swell to look at, a great actor at the edge of his life. But how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty ?<br /><br />In an interview ████████ states, that there is no woman in the film. Not in the very red circle, but I remember well that jolly good looking female ████ ███████ (with no future career). We are in the 70s. There in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover █████. ██████ did something like that 10 years earlier. This time ████████ was directing. Well done.<br /><br />The RED CERCLE has certainly added a few but not many glittering gems to film history. The robbery at Place Vendome and Montands wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and ███████ escaping ██████ in white underwear and carrying his trousers carefully across a stream. That is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie. But the 110 minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level. And there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late ████████ ██████ is also featured.<br /><br />███████ █████
