I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized ███ ███████ from the movie "██████ ███ █████." What attracted me to "█████ ██████" were the great songs sung by the "Sons of the Pioneers." Merian C. ██████, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. ██████ hired ███ ███████ to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong. ███████ would later win an Oscar for the theme for "Gone With the Wind.' ██████ was also the producer of "██████ ███ █████." If you remember, music was important to the big ape which would only respond to the sound of ███████ ██████'s "█████████ ███████." In 1947, ██████ would partner with ████ ████, who directed "█████ ██████." Of all of Ford's famous westerns, this one is my favorite which features his brother ███████ and a sullen █████ ██████.
