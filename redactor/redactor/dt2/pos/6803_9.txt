One of the enduring classics from MGM came out in the closing years of World War II, it's the film that made young █████████ ██████ a star. She had done a few films as a child actress before National ██████, but when it came out her place in the movies was assured. Ironically enough biologically she'd be growing up fast enough after National ██████ was out and her next struggle as an actress was to get substantial adult roles because casting directors only saw her as innocent little ██████ █████ who loved her jumping horse.<br /><br />I'm not sure of how this would work because steeplechase horses have to have confirmed bloodlines and the Pi's are a subject not dealt with in National ██████. All we know is that he's a reckless and untrainable horse in the hands of Reginald ████ and after he breaks free and causes considerable damage, ████ gets rid of him for a nominal price to the local butcher ██████ █████.<br /><br />At the same time as these things are happening, ██████ ██████ comes wandering into the lives of the Brown family which consists of █████, wife ████ ██████, and daughters ██████ ████████, ███████ ███████, and █████████ ██████ and their little brother █████ ███████. ██████ is a former jockey who's now on the open road and heading for the Brown family where his father was once a horse trainer for ████ ██████'s family. It's he who sees the potential of the Pi (short for pirate) as a steeplechase jumper and it's █████████ who convinces █████ not to pass up this chance.<br /><br />█████████ ██████ was so sweet and innocent in National ██████. The Good Book says you have to have faith like a child and she has it to spare. She infuses ██████ with it, to have faith in the heart and ability of the Pi and to leave a little over for himself.<br /><br />████ ██████ won a Best Supporting Actress Award for National ██████. She's a very wise mother who has hidden depths to her that the audience doesn't suspect. It turns out that back in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory swimming the English Channel and her prize money, saved all these years, she gives to her daughter. That scene is probably what won her the Oscar. National ██████ also won one other ███████ █████, for ████ Editing.<br /><br />Over 60 years after it made its debut National ██████ as a family classic hasn't lost a thing. Its depiction of life between the World Wars in Great Britain is still a standout. And National ██████ launched a movie legend. Can't do much better than that for high regard.
