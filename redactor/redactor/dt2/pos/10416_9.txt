I was enchanted by █████'s debut. I hope that we'll soon see more of his work. I was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief NYC run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as Desperately Seeking █████ and After █████, but with a gentle European whimsey that made it fresh and fun. A strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure. And I thought the complexly inter-threaded plots were just right. ██████ ████████ puts in her best performance since King of Comedy, while █████ ████████ is hilarious, and Ling Bai touching. See it.
