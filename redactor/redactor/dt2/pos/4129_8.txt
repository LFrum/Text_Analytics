The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.<br /><br />As █████ ████████ remarks in ████ █████████'s movie about █████, there's some Buddy █████ in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.<br /><br />Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of █████, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music. As a long-time █████ fan and rocker, so do I.
