Years before pre-nuptial agreements became a regular thing, ██████ ████████ made a screen comedy on which they are the basis. █████████'s ██████ ████ involves ████ ██████ as a multi-millionaire living on the French Riviera who's been married seven times and now marries █████████ ███████ for number eight. But ██████'s a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex-wives for a $50,000.00 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him. Sounds like what we now call a pre-nuptial agreement.<br /><br />Of course █████████ wants a lot more than that and she feels ██████ takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage. She'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it.<br /><br />█████████'s ██████ ████ has some really funny moments, the original meeting of ██████ and ███████ in a men's store where ██████ is insisting he wants only pajama tops and ███████ looking for only bottoms. And of course my favorite is ███████ trailing and blackmailing the detective ██████ sends to spy on her. ██████ Bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame, flustered detective.<br /><br />I've often wondered how back in the day █████████ could get away with casting so many people who are non-French in a film like this. Of course ██████ is an American and ███████ of the cast is the only one actually of French background. Though █████ █████ is charming as always, having him be a Frenchman is ludicrous, he is sooooooo British.<br /><br />Nevertheless █████████'s ██████ ████ is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called 'the Lubitsch touch' back in the day.
