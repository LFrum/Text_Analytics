Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how ██████ and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by █████████ and others.<br /><br />How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of ████ █████), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop. 9 Million) is the "world Capital of the Book," or that this beautiful city is host to the world's LARGEST International Theatre Festival? I hope that ████ █████, █████ ███████ (-Mr. & Mrs. Smith), ██████ ████████, █████ ██████ (Romancing the Stone) one day visit ██████, to see how wonderful it really is, and focus on ██████'s cultural vitality and diversity, instead of myopically producing films such as █████ ████ of Grace from which ██████ ███████ profited greatly (for this terrific film) without ever thinking-through about the ontological damage his film would help to perpetuate upon the "unfairly tarnished image" of Colombia.<br /><br />-Anyway, you will at least enjoy Bluff very much! -Oh, and thanks IMDb for your invaluable/great work!!!
