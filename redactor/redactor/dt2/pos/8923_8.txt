This is an excellent film, full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. The characters are well drawn, with ████ the biggest loser of all time.<br /><br />████ ████████'s character is the most vicious thing I've seen on screen since ████ ████████'s portrayal of █████ ██████ in 'Hitler: The Last Ten Days.'<br /><br />I just wish they'd all got away with it. But without giving too much away, there are some situations you just cannot lie your way out of.
