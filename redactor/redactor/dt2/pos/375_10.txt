When ██████ █████████ made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes, and his contractual arrangement with █████ ██ ████████ ended because of this. Actually he made some really good films in the period, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE, and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked, the audiences were turned off by █████'s attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by ████████ ████ in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film), and the willingness of █████ to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of it's star ██████ ███████ and ███████ █████████ broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasn't). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in it's favor.<br /><br />With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, █████████ shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by ████████ █████████, the story was of how ███ ██████, a professional tennis player, meets a fan of his - █████ ███████, a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. █████ is talkative and fawning, and ███ views him as one of the typical fans he has met...if a little eccentric, with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space. But █████ knows all about ███'s personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named ██████, and is in love with ████ ██████, daughter of a Senator. █████ knows that ██████ won't divorce her successful celebrity husband. █████ mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who is constantly criticizing him. Then █████ mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect, unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. ███ listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea. The train reaches ███'s destination, and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the "eccentric" █████ is a sociopath, and believes ███ has just agreed to the two killing each other's foe!<br /><br />It's a wonderfully simple plot actually. █████, of course does kill ██████, but he fully expects ███ to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. ███ is horrified - and worse, he finds that he is the police department's number one suspect. When █████, to encourage ███, mentions he has the latter's lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site, ███ finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police, and how to control (if possible) the insane █████?<br /><br />█████ always planned the shots of his film carefully, so that from the start we see both our "heroes" from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and █████, with a typical twist, makes the mad █████ actually more of an attractive figure. His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful, and he will have ███ live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life. One suspects that once ███ too had one, but his marriage's failure, coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman, has made him more circumspect and dull than he was.<br /><br />The cast is good too. ██████ ██████ probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death). It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes. As ███ ██████ ███████ acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE, especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to █████ ███████). As for the ladies, █████ ██████ is properly sluttish as ██████ - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering █████ in his act of evil. ████████ █████████ appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth █████), who bears a close resemblance to ██████, and accidentally sets off █████ at a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth █████ is properly supportive of Granger, but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background, and somewhat low keyed. Other supporting performers, ███ ██ ██████ as the Senator, ██████ █████ (usually a comedian) as █████'s dotty mother, and █████ ██████ as an unexpected recipient of violence from ██████ are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master.
