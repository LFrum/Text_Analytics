████ █████ did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend █████ █████(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that █████ █████(█████) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work. That's one of the reasons he didn't act like █████. He stuck to his kinder ways. That really makes him good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock-n-roll, that turned █████ off big time. Getting used to the different atmosphere was a challenge to █████ and his friends. He got to tour with ███ █████, went to the famous Apollo, which the all-Afro-American audience quickly accepted them, I liked that! And ███ █████ made sure █████ and his band got some service. That's what I call tolerance. It's sad that he, ███████ ██████, and J.P. "The Big Bopper" ██████████ had their music careers cut short by a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will live on in our hearts. I don't what inaccuracies were in the movie, all I care is that █████ █████ overcame the obstacles of music and politics in that time, and the music is nearly-perfect. For ████ █████, he was perfect in the role, and making the music as well. GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSEY! 5 STARS!
