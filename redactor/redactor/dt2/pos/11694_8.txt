I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm ███████ █████████████ ████ ████████. The film's title and in fact much of the outline of the film is from the ██████ ██████ poem Beauty in Trouble. ███ ███████ directs a screenplay by ████ █████████ from a story by ███████ and █████████. the story begins in 2002 when ██████ is hit by one of those devastating 100 year floods that destroys the household of ███████ (Ana Ceislerová) and █████ (█████ ██████) and their two children ████ (████ █████) and Lucina (████████ ████████). Because of the moldy conditions where they now live ████'s asthma is life threatening. ███████ works and █████ runs a chop shop out of the garage they live next to. █████'s shady occupation runs him afoul of the law and one of his theft victims becomes infatuated with ███████. █████ Benes (█████ ██████) is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers to care ███████ and her two kids. ████ █████████ is ████████'s mother who lives with her common-law husband called █████ ██████ played by ████ █████████ in probably the film's best role. Rounding out this excellent cast is ██████ █████████ as █████'s mentally fragile mother who gives any money she gets to the local religious charlatan. There is a lot going on here for a small film and it's good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief. ████ Brezina provides the music score with additional music from Czech singer ██████ and Irish singer ████ ███████. There is a lot to like about this film and I would give it an 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.
