While escaping from a heist of a bank, the outlaw █████ ████ (████████ █████) helps ██████ █████████ (Dean Jagger), the chief-engineer of the Western Union that is surveying the Wild West and had had an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired to work for the Western Union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from Omaha to ████ ████ ████. Vance and the engineer from Harvard ███████ █████ (██████ █████) flirt with the gorgeous ██████'s sister ███ █████████ (Virginia Gilmore) and she chooses Vance. However, his past haunts him when the outlaw ████ █████ (██████ ███████) steals the Western Union cattle disguised of Indians.<br /><br />"Western Union" is a good but predictable western directed by █████ ████. The story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the West, facing thieves and Indians. The entertaining story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of the identity of ████ █████, there is no surprise in the story. ████████ █████ gives another magnificent performance with a great cast. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")
