The above profile was written by me when I used the nick of OldWereWolf56 which is still my email address. I still believe ████ ██████'s character of Frisky is the best ████████ ████'s episodes ever and I watch this episode at least once a year as I consider ██████ to be a fortunate man as he has many friends who love him dearly. <br /><br />In case many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61, ████ ██████ hosted a children's entertainment show in the 50's I believe called ████'s ████. On it he had three assistants: a cat named Midnight who played the violin, a mouse named ███████ who played an a hand organ and a devilish toad named ██████ who's could appear and disappear at will embarrassing many of ████'s funny guest stars like █████ ███████.
