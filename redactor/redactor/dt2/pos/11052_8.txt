78 years ago...the premiere of "████ ████████" advertised by the slogan "█████ █████!" The film runs for 16 minutes and the viewers reach the climax of curiosity: Greta enters the bar and gets through a long awaited transfer from silence into sound: a few seconds closing her silent era and, at last, █████ █████ says a historic line: "Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy, baby!" <br /><br />"████ ████████" (1930) is the movie by ████████ █████ that introduced a great silent star █████ █████ to talkies. Nowadays, we can only imagine what serious transfer it was for actors and actresses. The careers of many were bound to end - something we hardly or not at all see at present. And it was no coincidence that it was ████████ █████ who directed the first talkie with the Swedish beauty. █████ trusted the director after two of his great silent productions, FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS (1928): movies that achieved a smashing success at the box office, both with █████ in the lead. <br /><br />But we are in 2008 and that fact about the movie, now purely historical, appears to be of minor importance. The question for today's viewer is not what █████'s voice sounds like but if the movie is still watchable after these 78 years. In other words, we all strive to answer the question if the movie has stood a test of time. Has it?<br /><br />When I recently watched it, I came into conclusion that, except for some minor technical aspects, including static camera, "████ ████████" is still very entertaining. It's, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, of a reality that the young woman faces (being based on ██████ █"█████'s play), and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs.<br /><br />CONTENT: █████ ██████████████ (██████ █ Marion), a heavy drinker, lives a life of a sailor, on a barge. Although his days are filled with sorrows, he is consoled by a letter from his daughter ████ (█████) whom he hasn't seen for 15 years. She says that she will come back to him. He starts to change everything for better; however forgets that his daughter is no longer a child lacking experience but a 23 year-old woman who has got through various sorts of things on a farm in Minnessota where she lived and worked. Moreover, he forgets that she has a right to accept another kind of male love in her life... This brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of the main character but the one which is introduced to us sooner than ████ (her father █████) makes you realize how universal it is. Simply no letter from the whole text that life appears to be has been erased after all these years. Cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid...<br /><br />PERFORMANCES. There are not many characters in the movie, but there are two that really shine in the roles. It is of course █████ █████ herself who did something extraordinary in her 15 year-long phenomenon, the presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema (something I have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on her films). But here, █████ is slightly different. I admit that there are moments in this movie when she does not feel very comfortable with her role. That seems to be caused by her new experience with sound in English; however, her performance is, as always, genuine and unique. But that is what everyone has expected from █████. The true surprise of the movie for the 1930 viewers and also for us is █████ ████████ as ██████. She is excellent in her facial expressions, in her accent, in the entire portrayal of a drinking woman who looks at life from the perspective of "hitting the bottle." Her best moments include the conversation with ████ ████████ in the bar preceded by her hilarious talk with █████. The rest of the supporting cast are fine yet not great whatsoever (here the German version makes up for it). Particularly ████████, except for █████ herself, constitutes an absolutely flawless choice.<br /><br />If you asked me what I like about "████ ████████" nowadays, that's what I would tell you: it's a classic movie. However, there is one more thing that I must mention at the end. It is humor, wonderful wit that is noticeable throughout. Although the content is quite serious and "████ ████████" in no way carries a comedian spirit (the only █████'s comedy was NINOTCHKA), there are such moments when you will split your sides. Don't skip, for instance, ████ and ████'s visit in the fun park, particularly at the restaurant where he orders milk for her thinking how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for himself and where suddenly ██████ joins them by chance...<br /><br />"████ ████████" is a perfect movie for classic buffs and a must see for all at least a bit interested in the true magnificence of performance. If you are fed up with many of those modern starlets, seek such movies out and you shall be satisfied. Very worth your search! <br /><br />█████ █████ █████! █████ █████ ████████! Let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie! █████ after all these years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are with us in a different sense...
