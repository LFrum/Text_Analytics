Clever psychosexual drama about a wounded Union soldier (█████ ████████) who seeks refuge in an isolated Confederate school for young women during the Civil War. Slowly, ████████ begins to seduce every girl in sight, until the tables are turned and he becomes the pursued in an unsettling, gothic-toned finale. Never has a film been so deliciously erotic yet disturbingly macabre at the same time.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly ████████'s finest hour (those who tune in for "█████ █████" will indeed be surprised), while the rest of the cast gives uniformly superb performances. Try to see the film on video, as television prints usually delete crucial flashback scenes between █████████ ████ and ███████ ████████.
