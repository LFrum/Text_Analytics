In short if you want to watch ████ ████████ best films than this one must be included. If you don't like ████ you may still like this. If you love ████ this may become one of your favorite movies of all time! Being from Atlanta it does hit home but it's also nice to see a cop/action/drama that takes place somewhere other than NY City, Chicago, Miami, or LA. The film is funny at points with & good plot & good performances from a great supporting cast (every character is real & the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out)A nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half & it has some good old fashion shootouts & fistfights (no CGI thank ███ REAL ACTION!)<br /><br />If █████ ████████ did his best impression of a ████ ████████ movie with "Every █████ ███ But █████" & "Any █████ ███ You Can" then ████ responded with his best █████ type flick with this, & it comes off great!
