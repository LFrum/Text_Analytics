In a really neat spin on Hitchcock, █████ (█████ ███████) and ████ (█████ ██████) lead unpleasant lives: █████'s ex-wife has gotten rich by publishing a book that he wrote, and ████ has the most overbearing mother imaginable. When █████ tells ████ to calm down by watching "Strangers on a Train", ████ gets the idea that they should do criss-cross murders like in the movie. And just like in the movie, █████ thinks that it's a joke, but ████'s serious.<br /><br />How they came up with the idea for "█████ █████ from the Train" I'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. There isn't a dull moment in it. And that ending was a hoot. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and ████ ██████ is as much of a hag here as she was in "The Goonies". A modern classic.
