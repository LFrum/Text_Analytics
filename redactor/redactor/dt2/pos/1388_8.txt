An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea, May 1891'. A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's Doctor a Lt. ██████ ██ ████ (███████ ██████████). It's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. The next morning morning ██████ wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach. He finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it. ██████ warns another surviving prisoner ████ (██████ ████████) not to drink the water as it will kill him. They both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners, █████ (███████ █████), ████████ (Francesco Mazzeri) and ████ (Giuseppe Castellano). ████████ wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food, he finds and kills a large water bird. But in turn he is killed himself by one of the fish-men. ██████, ████, █████ and ████ continue to explore the island as they put ████████'s death down to an animal attack of some sort. Soon after ████ is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit. Now only ██████, ████ and █████ are left. They stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. ██████ spots a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes. A woman on horseback named ██████ ██████ (███████ ████) is revealed to be ███████ saviour. She tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a Edmund ███████ (███████ ███████) and he doesn't like visitors. ██████, ████ and █████ decide to carry on regardless, eventually finding ███████'s large house in which they are invited to stay. That night █████ goes after ██████ and tries to rape her in a swamp, █████ quickly becomes food for the fish-men. And a Voodoo priestess called Shakira (█████ ██████████), who lives with ███████, performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. The next day ██████ and ████ decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about ███████ and think he is lying to them. ████ rides off on horseback and is lost. ██████ is saved from one of the fish-men by ██████ and is again told to leave. ██████ wants to confront ███████ again. ███████ reveals that he has a scientist, and ██████'s father, named █████████ ██████ ██████ (████ph Cotten) who he needs to be kept alive. ███████ says that the longer ██████ stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase. ███████ tells ██████ his plan. ███████ has found the lost city of Atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. He is using the fish-men as a means of getting at the lost treasures of Atlantis, and needs ██████ and her father to control them. He claims the fish-men are descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. ███████ offers ██████ a share of the treasure if he will help him keep ██████ alive. Later ██████ remembers the name ██████ ██████ as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings. Finding ██████'s secret laboratory he discovers ███████ had lied to him and the fish-men aren't descendants, their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by ██████'s grotesque experiments! ███████ has finally had enough of ██████ and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water, as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. ███████ wants to leave the island with his treasures and ██████, will ██████ escape almost certain death to save ██████ and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? Directed by ██████ ███████ I really liked this film that mixes various genres. The script by ██████ ██████ is fast paced, interesting and entertaining. The plot is revealed bit by bit, which kept me interested in watching it all the way through. I must say at this point that I've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's US release by █████ ██████. ███████ ████ makes for an extremely attractive leading lady, but I hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off, I thought it was more than a little distasteful. ███████ ███████ makes a great villain and ███████ ██████████ a likable hero. The fish-men themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and I've seen worse. Some of the miniature effects look a little poor too, but overall again I've again seen a lot worse. There's no real gore, violence or nudity in it, but that didn't really bother me actually. The photography by █████████ ████████ and the production design by ███████ █████████ ██████ combine to create a very nice looking film. Period costumes, props and sets like ███████'s house and ██████'s lab with it's old scientific equipment. The lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show. I really liked this film and I was entertained throughout it's running time. I'm not sure who I'd recommend it too as it mixes various genres, I guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made. If you can find a copy give it a go, I'm glad I did.
