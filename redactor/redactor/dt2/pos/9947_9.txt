OK, I admit it, I'm 40 and still shed a tear every time I watch ██████ calling back his █████ at the end.<br /><br />"█████, now stop! Don't do it, stop the attack...█████, what are you doing, █████... █████, where are you going█████, come back! █████...█████ please! Don't do it, you'll die... █████... █████, please comeback! I need you here█████ █████... █████! █████ █████" -██████ █████, The Last of ███████ ██████████<br /><br />Of all the Tokusatsu thats out there, █████ robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there. I credit it with getting me into everything sci-fi and anime when i was a kid. <br /><br />LIVE ON GR!
