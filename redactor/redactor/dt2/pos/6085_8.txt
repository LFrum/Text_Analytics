███████ █████████'s 'The ███████ ███████' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 ███████ ██████, the film owned the night, taking home nine awards from twelve nominations, the most decisive cleansweep since ████████ ██████████'s 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author ███████ ████████'s 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, 'The ███████ ███████' is a touching meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of World War Two.<br /><br />During the war, a man (█████ ███████) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition, and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia, he is assumed to be an Allied soldier, and is simply referred to as "the English patient." After the war, in the mine-ridden hills of Italy, a kind nurse, ████ (████████ ███████), who has apparently lost everybody close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time, she comes to learn more and more about her "English patient," who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, █████ ██████ de ██████. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks, we learn of ██████'s former exploits in the Sahara desert, and his romantic liaison with a married woman, █████████ ███████ (███████ █████ ██████).<br /><br />It's certainly easy to see why 'The ███████ ███████' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film, blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer ████ █████ captures the landscape to perfection; not since █████ ████'s magnificent 'Lawrence of ██████' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from ██████'s plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments, excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances from all the cast members.<br /><br />A long-time favourite actor of mine, 'The ███████ ███████' might just contain █████ ███████' finest performance, and, considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener,' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His █████ ██████ de ██████ is initially a very sympathetic character, but, as we slowly learn more about his past, his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. "Ownership" is a major theme of the film. When asked by █████████ what he hates most, ██████ replies with "Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me." However, as the relationship progresses, and █████████ perhaps tries to distance herself from him, ██████ reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: "I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine, which belong to me."<br /><br />████████ ███████, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as ████, the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for ██████ alone, she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief, █████ ██████████ (██████ █████), who lost his thumbs during the war, and who suspects that it was ██████ who betrayed him to the Germans. ████ also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with ███ (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb-diffuser in the British Army. However, due to her past history, ████ is afraid that becoming involved with ███ will doom him to death, particularly considering his very dangerous line of work.<br /><br />At 160 minutes in length, 'The ███████ ███████' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful, but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless, in every case, it is always better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.
