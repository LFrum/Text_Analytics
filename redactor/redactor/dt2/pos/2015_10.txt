This is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'The Wedding ██████'. Whilst the 'Wedding ██████' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, '████ Star' is all about metal.<br /><br />████ ████████ plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and ████████ ███████ plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.<br /><br />The story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of ████'n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly! The whole concert feeling is very well captured, since they used real audiences (no cgi here).<br /><br />Great direction and a brilliant performance by █████ ████, who acts like a true metal dude!<br /><br />'████ Star' is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you are going to love this movie!<br /><br />10/10
