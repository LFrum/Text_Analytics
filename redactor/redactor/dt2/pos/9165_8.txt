The Italian concept of "sprezzatura" was the grace and nonchalance in social manners that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century manual "The Courtier." The film "█████" is worth watching for the embodiment of the "sprezzzatura" concept in the dynamic performance of ████ █████.<br /><br />█████ plays the character of ████ "█████" █████ens, who is a professional dating consultant to those short on luck and confidence. The best scenes are when █████ coaches the painfully shy and maladroit ██████ in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in █████'s own attraction to ████ and a surprise for her when visiting █████ ██████. In these scenes, █████ is supported with good work from █████ █████ and ███ ██████. But this film is driven by the charm and winsome personality of █████.<br /><br />From start to finish, █████ rises above the average comic script to make "█████" an eminently watchable and entertaining film. I do not believe there is another actor working today who is capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like ████ █████ in this film. And his secret is in the "sprezzatura"!
