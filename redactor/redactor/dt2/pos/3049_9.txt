This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to ███ █████ ████████ for showing it uninterrupted. ████ ██████, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as ████ ████████'s excellent portrayal of ███ █████. I can't see why anyone would say that ████ ██████ is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, ███████ ████? Although his career is laudable, an actor such as ████ would have cheapened the role. Cronyn was an excellent choice for the part. I will count this film as a true treasure to hold in memory.
