More of a near miss than a flop, ███ ████████ stars ████ █████ as ████, heir apparent to and later king of a small European nation, who falls in love with a willing American actress and entertainer, ██████ █████ (████ ██████), but due to machinations by the sly prime minister of ████ as king, nicely played by ██████ █████████, the lovers are separated for 12 years before being reunited in Palm Springs where their love is rekindled. ████████ ███ ███████, who also scripts, is not able to fully utilize his talent for snappy dialogue because of █████'s tentative English usage, and the requisite rewriting, coupled with less than total rapport in evidence between the two stars, results in a somewhat raggedy tone to the screenplay, exacerbated by the studio's unkind cutting of many scenes, leading to a confusing ending. The overpowering █████ dominates his scenes with ██████, but both performers score with good work, while ████████ ████ is impressive with her patter effects as written, with ██████ ████████ placed on track by █████ ██ █████ for SINGIN' IN THE RAIN as a result of her sprightly performance here; only █████ ████████ is heavily victimized by the flagrant cutting. Prettily filmed largely in Pebble Beach, California, and other Monterey County environs, the film is endowed with █████'s iron strong operatic basso in Solamente Una Vez, as well as with original songs by ██████ █████ and ███████ ██████, with ███████ ███████ splendidly handling the sound recording, and notice must be made of the fine set decorations by █████ ██████, and the effective costume designs by ██████ ████████.
