"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by ████ ██ ██████████, is a very good pastiche of █████████ ████████, especially █████'s. The first half is great, which, apart from the opening which is a direct nod to "For a Few Dollars More", with █████, Colonel Douglas Mortimer and ██ █████ lookalikes walking into a ghost-town and then promptly killed by a Bounty Hunter called "The Stranger", is entirely serious, with great gunfights (especially the train-robbing scene), fast and furious action and nice performances from ███████ ██████, ██████ ██████ and (who manages well, considering that he is badly miscast) ███ ██████. But then, when the film reaches the half-way mark, there is a jokey fist-fight between ██████ and ██████. It isn't very funny, and is the weakest part of the film, but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light. You realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of Spaghetti Western conventions, and in retrospect, the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent. What now follows is a more obvious parody, with even some acrobatic jumping around from ██████ that predates all those seventies ██████ ████████. The ending, a complete send-up of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" climax, is very well done, as in other hands it could have been very silly. So, a pretty fun Spaghetti Western, that doesn't take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes █████████ ████████.
