This film has to be as near to perfect a film as ████ ████ made. The film is magic, a masterpiece, the reason ████ was, well ████. If you want to know why ████ was great this one explains it.<br /><br />The photography of course is superb, black and white as black and white should be, wonderful shots, not an over the shoulder conversation in it, pure ████, great moments, big and little. The famous ripped pants of ████ ████. Apparently two dogs kept invading the set and fighting so ████ wanted to use them in the fighting scene, but instead of fighting one dog ran away and the other attacked ████ ████ and ripped his pants, which caused ████ no end of mirth. A whole scene around plaiting a rope. The way ███ ███████ burn then snuffs his rope, wonderful foreshadowing and anticipation of the final. █████ █████'s naive courting of Prudence. The usual ford line about being scared and not showing it. Bond's horse accidentally falling in him and its left in the film. ███████ and Bond are fantastic in that scene. Lord help any ████ actor who does not stay in character while the camera is rolling even when a horse falls on top of you.<br /><br />A couple of very sweet romances, not intruding on the whole focus, two very likable leads, not to mention for the girls, the number of times the cameras focus on ███ ███████'s rather delightful backside.<br /><br />Lots of old time stuntmen getting lines and roles, █████ █████, █████ ███████. Some wonderful character studies mostly of faces staring, all the villains and main stars. A set of villains to rival any group in any western.<br /><br />Many many ████ian shots of faces, groups, children, women, small things happening, foals in the background (████ seems to love images of foals), women in aprons, allowing the moment as wagons cross rivers and the camera lingers.<br /><br />This is probably not a western as much as an artist's picture that happens to be set in the west.<br /><br />Lucky the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine such a film could be ever made again, but then it is such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege to attempt it
