██████ ██████ ███████ (a winningly spunky performance by gorgeous former "Playboy" Playmate Jeanne Bell) goes to Hong Kong to take out the evil heroin ring that murdered her brother. ██████'s assisted by friendly karate master ███ (amiable Chiquito), faces opposition from undercover narcotics agent Elaine (lovely, buxom blonde babe ███ ████████), and romances cocky, ruthlessly ambitious Charlie (essayed with supremely arrogant aplomb by ████ ████) while plotting her revenge against nefarious drug kingpin Sid (an effectively slimy ███ ████████). ████████ █████ ██ ████████, working from a blithely trashy script co-written by none other than ████ ██████ (!), crams the lively and eventful 72 minute running time with a plethora of gratuitous distaff nudity and loads of badly staged martial arts fight scenes (Bell is clearly doubled by a squat guy wearing a giant Afro wig!). The definite sleazy highlight occurs when a topless Bell singlehandedly beats up a bunch of thugs in her hotel room. ██████ Sacdalan's raw, grainy, scratched-up cinematography, the clumsy use of strenuous slow motion, the funky-groovin' score, the laughably inept fight choreography, and the surprisingly gruesome conclusion add immensely to the overall scuzzy fun of this deliciously cheesy grindhouse exploitation hoot.
