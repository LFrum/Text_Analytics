████ ██████, actor and director better known for more robust fare such as "The Misfits" and "African Queen," directs his daughter, ████████ ██████, in what would be his last film. Indeed, the film was released after ██████'s death. Based on █████ █████'s novella of the same name, "The Dead" tells the quiet story of a New Year's celebration in 1904 Dublin. ██████, his cast and his screenwriters, including his son ████, have created a gem of a movie. The novella is among █████'s finest works (as well as being the only one that is filmable). The film is a tribute to ██████'s genius. He has taken a small,beautiful story and has made a small, beautiful movie. █████ McCann and ████████ ██████ shine (although "shine" is too showy, too flashy a word to describe their quiet, understated performances). "The Dead" reflects the ██████ family's love for Ireland and is, in its own quiet way, a fitting final movie for a legend.
