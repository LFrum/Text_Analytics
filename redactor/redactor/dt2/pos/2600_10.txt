The "Hunting Trilogy" of ██████ ████ (1951), ██████ █████████ (1952), and ████! Rabbit! ████! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the █████ █████████████ ███████ collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the "greatest" or "most important" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. ███████ Maltese never got the credit that directors like █████, ███████ or █████ got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make ██████ Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made.
