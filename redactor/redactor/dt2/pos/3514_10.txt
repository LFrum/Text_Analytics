Just Before dawn is an excellent horror movie. It is atmospheric, filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature, in which few young people meet their doom, in the shape of two crazed, fat bastards,who slaughter them. ████ █████████ is very talented and intelligent director,who is unfortunately underrated. He achieved to built tension, not with gore,but with showing menacing nature environment. █████████ succeeds to built a tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way, not to show to the viewer the gore, but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters. <br /><br />Just Before ████ was always compared to █████ ████████ ████████, Deliverance and █████ have eyes. It is as good looking as Deliverance, better than █████, I mean scarier and better crafted,and it is creepy as The █████ ████████ ████████.<br /><br />JBD is one of the best horrors of past few decades, who finally lives on DVD!
