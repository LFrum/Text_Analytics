Only the Brits could make a film like this and have it be so tastefully charming! Betty (██████ Blethyn) wants something more out of life, but she doesn't know what, when she realizes she is in love with her childhood friend, █████ (██████ ██████), who owns the local funeral parlor. Meanwhile, an American mortician (███████████ ██████) who "wants to put the 'fun' back in funerals" moves into this small Welsh community with his assistant (███ █████) and wants to give █████ a run for his money with flashy, themed funerals. (Star Trek funeral, anyone?) ██████ and █████ decide to stage ██████'s death and funeral, with hilarious results. A very enjoyable film - if you're a fan of British comedies such as "Waking Ned Devine", you'll love this.
