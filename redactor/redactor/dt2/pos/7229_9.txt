In the seedy streets somewhere in New York City, a lonely punk named ██████ ( ████ ██████) has little friends but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercing and just party all the time. He does fall for a beautiful rich girl named ██████ ( ████ ██████) whom is also troubled as her father is being quite an abusive son of a you know what, but as our title characters meet and fall for each other things start becoming quite magical for them. Unfortunately their fathers are at each other as ██████'s dad wants to take over ██████'s dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them all and stop this feud? <br /><br />Hilarious and gross horror comedy drama satire from the wacky and disgusting people at █████ is a wonderful modern day take on ███████ ███████████'s █████ and ██████. This was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews for this is a dark humored satire of the legendary story that started it all, it's got some good laughs, piercing, graphic violence and gore such as a head being smashed on a fire hydrant. For me this is the third best █████ movie next to the immortal "█████ ███████" and "█████'s War" being second, yes the acting can be a little bad like some █████ flicks but the stuff above makes it up for that and this is a must see movie if you like horror comedies, █████ ███████, and █████ or if you wanna see a comical version of a beloved story, BTW also look for a couple of amusing appearances by The █████ ███████ and SGT. █████████ NYPD.<br /><br />Also recommended: "The █████ ███████", "Meet The Feebles", "Ichi The Killer", " Re-Animator", "██████ ██████", "Class of Nuke'Em High", "█████ and ██████ ( 1968 and 1996)", " Pieces", " █████'s War", " ███████ █████: The █████ ███████ 4", "██████ ████", " Riki-Oh: The Story of █████", " Demons", "New Nightmare", " ██████ Vs.
