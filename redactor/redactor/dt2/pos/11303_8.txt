For once a ██████ movie that is good. I'm 18 and a embarrassed to say this but I'm hooked on these movies. I hated ██████ when I was younger but the movies I love. ██████ is so cute and I've fallen in love with him. He's so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with █████. Oh man I'm in love with ██████. I love ██████ determination not to give up on hope and eventfully it works. I love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones. ██████ & ████ ████ is other brilliant movie. I would recommend this movie to children of all ages (even boys) because the movie is that good and I'm hard to please. ██████ and the Magic of Pegasus is a movie that is enchanting and exciting.
