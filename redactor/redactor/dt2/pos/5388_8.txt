I may differ from many people on this board but I enjoy watching Mind Of ██████. The reason I like Mind Of ██████ is the host is not afraid to speak his mind or exploit stereotypes. ██████ ██████ does what we all do with our friends but are unwilling to admit and then some.<br /><br />██████ has no problem doing jokes about any race, religion, sex, or orientation. While he gets a lot of flack for this it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. ██████ does not care if he offends anyone but he is not a racist and even does jokes about his own race.<br /><br />The typical format for the Mind of ██████ goes like this: there will be an open skit making fun of a person or recent event. ██████ then comes out and does a 5 or 6 minute stand up where he talks about various issues. The show then has 2 separate skits divided by commercials. In these skits ██████ does a variety of things such as making fun of people, giving his personal opinions with a funny twist, or simply doing parodies of people, events, or movies. At the end of the show ██████ comes out for a minute with either one final skit or something else to say.<br /><br />People criticize ██████ for exploiting stereotypes and say his statements are overly offensive. ██████ only does what everyone else thinks of certain races but are afraid to say. As for ██████ being offensive he is only speaking his mind. I find nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />The show is not perfect. The skits can be not put together the best and sometimes ██████ does go over the line in his jokes. For the most part however it is a show where the comedian says what is on his mind no matter what the consequences and presents in in a humorous matter. So if you aren't afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone speak his mind and often say what you have wanted to say then watch Mind Of ██████. However if you are easily offended you should not watch this show because you will be offended or worse yet you might even laugh.
