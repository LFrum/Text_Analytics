In the 2nd of his Historical Martial Arts films, Chiba portrays his real life sensei ███ █████. The film even recreates █████'s incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands (█████ did this feat over 50 times in real life). ███████ fight choreography featuring authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically this is one of the rare █████ █████ films in which he DOESN'T tear out or rip off body parts of opponents. A must see for █████ █████ fans definitely one of his top 5 films
