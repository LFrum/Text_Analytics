Although films about █████ ████ █████████ famous Rousseauian hero ██████ have been seen by movie goers for almost a century now, this is the definitive version of the story. █████████ is the actual story of the origins of ██████ as set down by █████ ████ █████████ way back in the second decade of the last century. I've been assured by experts.<br /><br />██████ and Sherlock ██████ are probably the most filmed fictional heroes in history. I've no basis in fact for saying that, just a gut feeling. The most popular ██████ was █████ ████████, the most popular ██████ was ██████ ███████████. And films that they made with both those characters will be criticized no end by purists.<br /><br />But █████████ is the real deal, a faithful adaption of Burroughs first story concerning the origin of his hero. I can't think of another film which shows that ██████ learned French before English, but that is shown here and it's only natural since it was a French survivor of a massacred safari played by ███ ████ who discovers ██████ who has been raised by the apes since his parents who were shipwrecked on the African coast died there after his mother gave birth.<br /><br />His parents were in fact the son and daughter-in-law of the ████ of █████████ and the surviving ████, played by █████ ██████████ is of course overjoyed to learn he has a grandson. Of course there are others who don't welcome the new heir back in society. <br /><br />One who doesn't is █████ ████████ playing of course ████. She does not communicate with ██████ in answer to his grunts and monosyllabic commands. ██████ speaks a concise English, French, and understands the language of the apes as well. As for the language of love, ██████ and ████ need no lessons.<br /><br />█████████ earned three Oscar nominations for best makeup in regard to the apes, best adapted screenplay and a posthumous nomination for █████ ██████████ for ████ ██████████ █████. It should also have rated a nomination for cinematography of the jungle scenes in Cameroun and the scenes of the British Aristocracy in several landmark places like ████████ █████ and ████████ Palace.<br /><br />For Burroughs purists, █████████ is the real deal.
