This is the most difficult movie I have ever seen...the emotional content is horrific, yet unforgetable. A woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning. The whole movie revolves around her interrogation. ████ ███████ and ████████ █████ have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve ██████ for their performances.
