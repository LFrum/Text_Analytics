I have watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and each time I watch it I am drawn into the movie and back to 1963! The Movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I watch it.<br /><br />I think the important thing to say here is I was 15 in 1963 and I can remember "before President ███████ was shot and before the ███████ came." I can feel myself saying something like, "I carried a watermelon." and then realizing just how stupid that was! ████████ Grey plays Frances "████" Houseman in █████ ███████. ████ is going to start college in the Fall. She goes to █████████'s for vacation with her family (mom, Dad and sister ████).<br /><br />One of the staff dancers, █████ (played by ███████ ██████) gets pregnant by another staff person (one of the college boys played by ███ ██████) and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and ██████ (███████ ██████) are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel.<br /><br />Thus, the need for a fill-in dancer for █████. ██████ is persuaded by █████ and his cousin █████ (Neal Jones) that he can teach ████ to do the dance in time for the show. ████ learning the dance steps with █████ and ██████ are wonderful scenes!<br /><br />████'s father (██████ ████ ████████ played by █████ ██████) comes to █████'s rescue when the abortion is done wrong. █████ ███████ brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had abortions in back rooms by butchers. Around this time (1963) many girls actually died from this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then.<br /><br />██████ █████ plays a great conceited grandson (Neil █████████) to ████ ██████'s Max █████████. ████ ███████ does a great job as ████'s annoying sister ████ Houseman.<br /><br />The music is great and the dancing is wonderful! The "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel ████'s astonishment when she first sees them dancing and says, "Where'd they learn to do that?".<br /><br />████████ Grey and ███████ ██████ are just perfect together in their respective roles. ███████'s song, "She's Like The Wind" brings tears to my eyes each time I hear/watch it in this movie.<br /><br />The movie ends on an up note, but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in ████'s and ██████'s lives. █████ ███████ gives something new each time it is watched - It mesmerizes the watcher with nostalgia, a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.
