"The Couch Trip" is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the '80s. In this case, ███ ███████ plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist, and he goes to ███████ █████ to sub for ███████ ██████. Most of the movie's humor springs from their satirical look at ███████ █████ and people's empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid).<br /><br />It's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time. Don't expect any kind of religious experience. But you'll most likely laugh a lot at how the ███████ █████ people flaunt their wealth. Also starring ██████ ███████, █████ █████, ████ █████ and Victoria Jackson (of "UHF").
