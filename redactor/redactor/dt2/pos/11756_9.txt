Those prophetic words were spoken by ███████ ██████ (as a war reporter) to the beauteous ████████ █████ (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair, despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. █████████ Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound), a famous title tune, poetic script, lovely background music (by ██████ ██████), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially █████ (directed here by █████ ████, who also did "The Song of Bernadette - 1943, an Oscar for █████) still make this a world-class romance weeper.
