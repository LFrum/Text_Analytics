█████ ███████ brings the story of ███████ █████████ to life as he almost narrates the entire film while he crosses the Atlantic. It well edited with flashbacks over Lindeberghs life. █████ ██████ score is shear brilliant and truly gives the picture a heroic feel. One of ███████s finest roles and this film can deliver time after time. Look for appearances by ██████ ████████ ( The Mayor in the JAWS Movie) as ███ Gurney.Comes out on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of a few more of ███████s classic films. I consider █████ ███████ to be Americas greatest Actor and never tire of seeing him in any film I see, watch this picture and you'll agree.
