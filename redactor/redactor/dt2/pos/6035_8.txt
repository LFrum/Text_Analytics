This ███████ episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The cast includes ████████'s ████ ████ ██████████ as the maestro, his wife played by ██████ ██████ (███████ ███████'s mom) and his mother-in-law played by █████ ███ (one of America's greatest leading actresses in film of our time). Anyway I disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing. I love watching ███████ with his beloved dog who he never names in the series. This time, the episode focuses in on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of L.A.'s attractions. Of course, ███████ becomes as interested in classical music as he does anything else involving a crime.
