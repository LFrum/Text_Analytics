██████ ███████'s "Il Prezzo Del Potere" aka. "The Price Of Power" is an excellent and enthralling █████████ ███████ that mirrors the ███████ assassination. A great leading performance by ████████ █████ and an excellent score by ████ ███████ are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie.<br /><br />In 1881 Texas is divided into those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace, and those who, after 16 years, still want to reinstall the confederacy. In spite of warnings, President █████ ████████, who wants to establish a new policy of equality, decides to visit Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officials are planning his assassination. ████ ██████ (████████ █████) and two of his friends, a black man named ████ ███████ (███ █████████), and a crippled guy named Nick (██████ █████) are determined to prevent the President's murder. <br /><br />Since █████ ████████ was not assassinated by racists, who wanted to reinstall the confederacy in Texas, but in Washington DC by mentally unstable ███████ ███████, the storyline of "Price Of Power" is, of course, historical nonsense. Since the movie, however, doesn't claim historical accuracy, but tries to allude to the 1963 ███████ assassination in Dallas, the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate. <br /><br />████████ █████ delivers an excellent performance as the main character ████ ██████, ██████ ██████████ is great as the villainous and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Some other good performances are those of ███ █████████ as ████'s black friend ████, ██████ ███████ as ██████ ████████, the president's adviser, and ████████ ███ as █████████, a villainous rich businessman. The Score by ████ ████████ ███████ is great, the cinematography and locations are great and (such as in ███████'s earlier "Day Of Anger") remind a lot of Sergio Leone, for whom ███████ used to work as an assistant director for "A Fistful Of Dollars" And "For A Few Dollars More". <br /><br />All said, "Il Prezzo Del Potere" is, after "Day Of Anger", another excellent █████████ ███████ that shows both the great talent of ████████ █████ as an actor and ██████ ███████ as a director. "The Price Of Power" is a must-see for █████████ ███████ fans, and I also highly recommend it to everybody else. 8/10
