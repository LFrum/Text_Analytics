███ ██████ and ███ ████████ always had a good following among children, but in their careers I think you could say that they only made one film that could be designated for kids. ████ and the Beanstalk was that one film.<br /><br />It was part of a two picture independent deal from Warner Brothers, the second film being ██████ and ████████ ████ ███████ ████. These were the only two films the boys made in color. <br /><br />The two of them, out of work as usual, take a job for a very precocious and obnoxious young █████ ████████ as a babysitter. Although it starts out with ████████ wanting to read the kid, ████ and the Beanstalk as a bedtime story, the young lad winds up reading it to ████████. ███ falls asleep and in his dreams he fantasizes he's indeed ████ the Giant Killer.<br /><br />███dy Baer who menaced the boys in Africa Screams plays the giant and he's got a giant size ███████ ████ as his housekeeper. ███████ was a big girl, 6'2", and you can imagine she had some difficulty being cast except when her height was used as a joke. One of the only players who ever looked down at her was ████ █████ in Three Godfathers at 6'4". █████ Fonda and █████ ███████ in On Our █████ ███ also stood barely above her, but again her height was part of a gag.<br /><br />█████ █████ and █████ █████████ were the princess and prince of the fantasy and they sang beautifully, but couldn't act worth anything. This was the last film of ███████ ██████ who's career dated from the early silent screen days and even to the turn of the last century on stage. He played princess █████'s father the king.<br /><br />Some not terribly memorable musical numbers came from ████ and the Beanstalk, save the title song. I well remember as a kid having the 78 record of ███ and ███ singing the song and reciting the story. I was in my early single digit years, but became a lifelong fan of their's through that and their television series.<br /><br />████ and the Beanstalk is still a good children's picture for the very young, though I would warn parents to warn their little urchins not to imitate young master Stollery.
