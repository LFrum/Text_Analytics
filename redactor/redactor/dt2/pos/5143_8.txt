In 'Hoot' █████ ██████ plays ███ █████████, the new kid in school who has just moved from Montana. But ███████ is a lot different from Montana. Despite is troubles in blending in, ███ discovers a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming to town and families of burrowing owls are in trouble. Can the new kid, a tomboy (████ ██████) and a runaway (████ ██████) stop big business from destroying these owls' home? <br /><br />This movie was pretty good. The kids (█████ ██████, ████ ██████ and ████ ██████) are the real stars of this film. ████ Wilson (Officer Delinko) is okay, but really does not have a very big part. Neither does ██████ ██████ (Mayor) or █████ ███████ (███ ████).<br /><br />Nevertheless this was a fun film that the whole family will enjoy. For a first time producer, I thought █████ ███████ put together a quality piece of work. Plus the owls were really cute.
