So I guess that ███ and ███ just liked to mess with classic stories (although they did have some interesting results). In this case, they're baby-sitting a bad boy, and ███ tries to read him "████ and the Beanstalk" but falls asleep and dreams that he's ████ and ███'s the butcher, and they climb the beanstalk to rescue the prince and princess from the giant (█████ ████).<br /><br />I think that my favorite scene was when ███ was trying to make the giant an omelet, and...well, I'll let you see what happens. As this was an ██████ and Costello movie, they did have a few unnecessary songs, but other than that, it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of the classic story, "Bewitched" and "████████'s Island" both had episodes portraying it.
