What a cast of actors and actresses in this ███████ episode, beside █████ ████, you have █████ ██████, █████████ █████, ██████ ██████ as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, █████ ██████, who plays the role so deliciously. █████████ █████ plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides ███████'s sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. ██████ ██████ plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money. Well, you'll just have to watch and see the outcome but I can assure you that it's always worth watching this one for the cast and the crew.
