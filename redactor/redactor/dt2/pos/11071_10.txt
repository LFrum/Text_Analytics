WOW I Love this movie. This is definitely added to my list of ██████ Movies.<br /><br />Juice - Starring █████ 'I don't giva F***' ██████ ██ ███████ - O-Dawg 'I'll smoke ███████, I just don't giva F****' New ██████ █████ - Hey they steal cars in broad daylight they obviously don't giva f***<br /><br />New ██████ █████ is the best hood movie ever. It is at the top of the list, menace II society is second, and juice is third, Clockers is really stupid.<br /><br />The soundtrack for New ██████ █████ is ██████ too ███ ████ & █████ ███ - All about my fetti is heard through out the movie.<br /><br />Lords of the underground - Burn rubber, another good song, and so is ███ & ██ ███████ - don't shut down on a player<br /><br />If your a fan of GTA-SA you'll freaking love this movie, AND The amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is basically Rap about stealing cars ^_^ SWEETTTT Movie!
