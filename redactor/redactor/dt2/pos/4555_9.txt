During my trip in a youth leadership forum, I was channel surfing until I found "█████ ███" on TBS. Since I have never seen this film before, I wanted to check it out. My roommate, who have already seen this, told me, "This movie is a classic." After seeing the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right.<br /><br />"█████ ███" is constantly funny from beginning to end, thanks to the comedic duo of █████ ██████ and █████ █████. ██████ is a riot as the title character, a spastic doofus who just sails through life as if it wasn't important. His slacker-esqe ways soon come to a halt when his father (█████ ███████), a wealthy "█████ ████ King", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This leads █████, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend ███████ (█████ █████), to hit the road to sell enough break pads to save the company.<br /><br />The main reason "█████ ███" works are the funny performances from the lead cast. ██████ is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person being █████ and the third being ███ ████ as the film's villain who has bad luck. Another funny guy is ███ ███████ as ███ ████████, a well-known auto parts extraordinare.<br /><br />Another reason the movie works is the large amount of jokes. █████ ██████ has hilarious slapstick moments, and █████ █████ has funny snide comments and one-liners. The gags in the movie (some which involves a deer and a airplane bathroom) are laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to director █████ █████ (█████ ███ 33 1/3), writers ██████ & █████ ██████<br /><br />(3rd Rock From the Sun, That 70s Show), and the cast.<br /><br />"█████ ███" is a really funny movie, although for some unknown reason most film critics (including █████ █████) find it horrible and unfunny. (I wonder when their sense of humor died.) I recommend "█████ ███" for those who are great fans of comedy. Thank you very much, roommate.
