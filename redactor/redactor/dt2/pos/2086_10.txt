This film was full of suspense and was well directed, the black and white effect made it a great mystery. ███ ███████,(█████ █████████) who was married twice to the famous musician ██████ █████████ and also the son of ███████ █████████, (FDR's ███) fell madly in love with ███████ █████( ██████ █████/Marsh). ██████ wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, even ████ ███████(████ █████████) and proposes marriage whenever he can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr. ████ █████)(famous radio and tv actress in the 30's and 40's played mostly small town MOM'S) warned the ladies about ██████ █████'s sick mind, and the abusive childhood he had when growing up, which caused his love/hate relationship with women. ███ ███████ and ███████ █████ would have been greater stars with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short lived in real life. This film is beyond critizing, it is a trully great 1945 film classic for many generations to view and enjoy!
