I cannot argue with other comments that the story line focuses more on the romance between the Mary ██████ and █████ █████ characters, much in the manner of "Showboat", than on the life of ██████ ███████. But in the 1930's, would that have been a box office draw? Instead of the Life of VH, perhaps it should have been the Music of VH. There is an abundance of this.<br /><br />For me, the thrill of the movie came near the end of the movie when ███████ ██████ sings "Land of Romance". It has been over a decade since I caught this movie for a second time at a local 'old movies' theater. At first the audience was stunned; then it burst into spontaneous applause. I remember the shivers running up and down my spine. My trivia memory recalled the information provided to an inquiring public by a local journalist when the movie first came out back in the late 1930's. 'That note hit by ████ ██████ was a far F above high C.'<br /><br />She may not have had four octaves a la ███ █████ but the then teen-ager certainly had a range!
