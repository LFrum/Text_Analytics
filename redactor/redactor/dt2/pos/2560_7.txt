Better than I expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage. The music is great, and cinematography focuses greatly on turning █████ into a trailer trash █████ █████ and it works. ██████ L. get's to shout a lot, which he's good at, as well as play lots of blues guitar, which he looks cool doing. Even ██████ ██████████ was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*%#, but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche, while still being an effective drama.
