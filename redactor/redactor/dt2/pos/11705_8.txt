This is the first feature film from Australian comedian ████ ██████. ████ wrote the film with his brother ███████ with help from ████ ██████, another comedian and actor. ████ & ████ also have starring roles along with several other iconic Australian actors - ████ ██████, █████ ██████ et al. The basic premise of the movie is that slimy ████ ███████ (████ ██████) has become a member of a Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his work. The Club is in dire financial straits and calls on ████ to help. ████ ██████ plays the clubs arch nemesis - he is trying to take the club over and turn it into a "█████ ███████ ████" ████ and the other club members band together to try and save the club with many funny twists and turns and █████ eventual redemption. This is quite a clever little movie. It is well above ████ ███████ usual gutter humor. It is pretty well written and well acted. The older Aussie actors are brilliant (████ ██████, █████ ██████ ██████ ███████ and ors) The film meanders along rather then going at break neck pace, but that adds to the charm of the movie. There is low level coarse language.
