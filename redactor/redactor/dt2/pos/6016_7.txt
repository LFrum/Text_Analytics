Based on the memoirs of █████ ████ ███, who painted a much more affectionate picture of their mother than did her sister, actress "████" June Havoc, in her autobiography, "Early Havoc" on which "They Shoot ██████, Don't They?" was loosely based. I saw █████ ██████ in the original Broadway production of Gypsy, and she was great as "████ ████" but certainly more "██████" than ████. I was disappointed with ████████ ███████'s portrayal in the 1962 movie version. An otherwise excellent actress, ███████ was a very wooden substitute for ██████. █████ Midler, by contrast, was better and more believable than ██████ and I'd recommend her performance as the definitive one.
