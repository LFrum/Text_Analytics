****SPOILERS**** ██████ under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to dig him out from under them undertaker ████ █████, ████ ██ ██████, came up with a plan to make a load of cash with the help of his two crooked pals ████ & Bo, ███████ █████ & ████ ███████. <br /><br />████ getting close with his boyhood friend █████ ███████, ███ ████████, as a mob informer to win over █████'s trust and have him tell ████ what's coming down on the streets of New York in regard to mob activities. █████ is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the NYPD, the Seven Ups, that does things "their way" to clean up the streets of New York of criminals. <br /><br />████ gets information from █████ and makes it look to █████ that he's really giving him tips about the mob and what it's up too and uses that information to tip off his hoodlum associates, ████ & Bo, to rip the mobsters off of their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob loan sharks and hold them for ransom.<br /><br />Everything is going well for ████ & Co. until the mob decides to retaliate and mistakenly grabs beats and kidnaps a member of the Seven Ups █████, ███ █████████,who was working undercover thinking he was one of the hoods who was kidnapping and ripping them off. Later █████ was accidentally killed by ████ when he blasted out the trunk of the car that █████ was locked in thinking that there was a suitcase full or cash, ransom, in it.<br /><br />Fast pace and exciting movie with that gritty and grimy photography of New York City that was so effective in the movie "The French Connection" which also stars both ███ ████████ & ████ ██ ██████ who are in this movie too. Incredible car chase that started in downtown Brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of New Jersey some 15 to 20 miles away with █████ almost ending up decapitated for his heroic efforts. <br /><br />███ ████████ who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor I can think off like █████ ████████ would have been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot of, he even looks a bit like him, former welterweight and middleweight champion ████ ███████ who beat the great █████ ███ ████████ for the middleweight championship back in 1957 and acts like him too in the movie : tough durable and destructive. <br /><br />████ ██ ██████ is very good as ████ the undertaker the lowlife heel who plays off █████ and the mob to the point that leads to █████'s partner █████ getting killed. Even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for ████ since he only wants the money he gets from the ripped offed mobsters to pay his sick wife's ████'s hospital and medical bills. Even the fact that █████ was killed due to his actions ████ never wanted anybody to get hurt but like they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned. In the end ████ have a lot of explaining to do to the not so sympathetic and caring mobsters. <br /><br />The movie "The Seven Ups" has the late ████ ███████ doing the dangerous stunts with the car chases as well as act in the film. ███████ was also the stunt man in both great movies that had him doing the driving on the roads streets and highways of New York City and ███ █████████ "The French Connection" and "███████".
