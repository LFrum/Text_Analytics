There have been several comments already on the site focusing on the "prestige" feel of the film - and there is a lot of heavy-weight talent on show: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to the magnificently rendered design and scoring, to the masterly direction. No wonder that ██████ █████ ██████'s acceptance speech for "Evita" at that year's ██████ began "Well, thank God that "The English Patient" had no songs in it." Writing of Oscar winners takes me to ████████ ███████, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. It is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for ████ █████ (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. Just as ████ ████████'s hugely well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in "██████'s End" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of "goodness" involving, so ███████'s win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy. Her performance in this terrific film is a thing of beauty.
