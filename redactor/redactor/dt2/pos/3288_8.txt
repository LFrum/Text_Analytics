Eager electronics whiz █████ ██████ (a likable performance by ██████ ████ of TV's "Land of the Lost") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for ██████ ████ Protection System) for his boss ███ █████ ██████ (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S.; said task proves to be easier said than done. ████████ ███ ███████ relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair. Moreover, the game cast mug it up with infectious aplomb: the adorable ███████ ██████████ as Brian's sweet fiancé █████ ██████, █████ ██████ as klutzy crook ██████, ███ ███████ as McCann's equally bumbling partner ███████, ███ ██████ as evil CEO ███ █████, ████████ ████████ as nice old biddy Ms. Foster, and 60's AIP exploitation feature regular █████ ██████ as smarmy, duplicitous suit ███ █████. Best of all, the titular pooch is a cuddly delight: C.H.O.M.P.S. jumps through fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer, and even does a few nifty martial arts moves. A subplot about a hulking neighborhood hound named ███████ supplies a few extra belly laughs (███████ is voiced by some uncredited guy with an appropriately deep, growly voice). The groovy animated opening credits sequence, ███████ ██ ███████'s glossy cinematography, and ████ ██████'s funky, pulsating disco score are all solid as well. A cute little kiddie flick.
