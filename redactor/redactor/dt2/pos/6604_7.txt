Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team, and their influence on skateboarding. It also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by █████ ███████, a member of the original ██████ ████, and was written by █████ ███████ and █████ ██████, another member of the team. The documentary stars the members of the ██████ ████ and is narrated by ████ Penn.<br /><br />The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing. It discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of █████ ██████, California. The ██████ ████ originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. The documentary mainly consists of the original ██████ ████ members talking about the past in the ██████ ████, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three particular members of the team; ███████, ████ ████, and ███ █████, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the team.<br /><br />The interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. Very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour. I think █████ ███████ used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (i.e. the Glory Days of the ██████ ████) and not the present. The documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as ████ ███████, ███ ████████ and █████ █████), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point. Knowing nothing about skateboarding (i.e. not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this doco was more about the ██████ ████ than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the boys in the team. Because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity.<br /><br />All in all, I would have to say this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It gave me a whole new insight, not just into the ██████ ████, but into skateboarding as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it must be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.
