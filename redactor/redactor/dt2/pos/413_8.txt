Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star ██████ ███████ (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by █████ █████) dies of a heart attack. A bunch of drama school students steal ███████'s corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. ███████ comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. Writer/director ██████ ████████ ████ concocts a fresh, original, and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise, offers a neat evocation of the glitzy █████████ milieu, and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere. The kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods, with a gal being set on fire, a juicy decapitation (the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it!), and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights. Kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar B-flick faces: Mayne has a deliciously eye-rolling ball with his flashy role, ████ █████ contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed-up director ████████, ████ ██████ adds some class as flaky psychic medium Mrs. Rohmer, plus there are nice turns by ████ █████████ as jerky drama student ringleader Saint, ████████ ████████ as the sweet Meg, ███████ █████ as the geeky ███, and █████ ███████ as the nerdy Bobo. Popping up in cool bits are █████ "Porky" Mitchell as a detective, ███████ ██████ in one of his customary policeman parts, and ██████ ████████ as a corpse. ████ King's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look. The moody score by █████ ██████ likewise hits the shuddery spot. A fun little fright flick.
