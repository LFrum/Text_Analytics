I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. ████████ was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in ██████ █████████'s "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and ███████ █████████'s "The Main Event" and ████ ██████'s "Meatballs", plus lots of TV shows like █████ █████ and TV movies. Me and my friends really enjoy her. But her starring role in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be, right on ████████ as the center of attention, probably the prettiest, hottest girl I've ever seen in movies.
