After learning that her sister █████ is contemplating divorce, ████ decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When ████ arrives, however, █████ is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, ████ tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, █████████ ██████████ gives a solid dramatic performance. ██████ ██████'s teleplay is based on a short story by McKnight ██████. ██████'s tale was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of █████ ███████'s THRILLER anthology series. THRILLER stuck very closely to the story, which is kind of a pity, for it could have used a little punching up. Granted ██████ wrote a moderately creepy number, but ██████ (creator of the ONE STEP BEYOND show) adds several clever ingredients that heighten the tension and suspense.
