████ ███iyaan is a great film. A very breezy entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s. The Music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of Majrooh are meaningless at places. ███ Anand is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role. ███████ is sexy and █████ is OK. ████ too is just about OK. The film has terrific dialogue by █████████ ████ who wrote most of ███ Anand's films like █████, Duniya, Warrant, █████ ████, Manzil, etc.etc.<br /><br />It is a story of ███ getting attracted to three females - the mod ███████, ████ and the homely █████. He eventually opts for █████. The story is about OK but its been narrated in a gripping way and the dialogue and █████ and the great ███ Anand are the highlight of the film. A must watch film for all ███ Anand fans.
