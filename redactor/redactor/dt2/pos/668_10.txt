█████ ██████' █████ ███ TV series had always generated a large number of complaints, both from the audience and from the people taking part. But, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. The 2001 █████ ███ Special. Before the hugely overrated █████ ████████ █████ arrived, the █████ ███ Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired.<br /><br />The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the █████ ███ Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! The subject that the program handled turned many heads, but the message was widely misinterpreted. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. This was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia. The show was purely about the media and it's presentation of the subject. ██████, is and always will be, a media satirist. The notion that the program 'makes fun' of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! ██████ never attempts to do either such thing. He merely draws our attention to the overwhelming, and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject.<br /><br />Using many of his established '█████ ███' characters, such as, ███ ████ and others, ██████ shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up, and the result is as funny, if not funnier, than anything ██████ has done previously. Using his tried and tested formula, ██████ manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary. In actuality, they are made to look like exactly what they are. Retards.<br /><br />All in all, the █████ ███ Special needs to be seen to be believed. And, with one opening line, ██████ manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
