This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. ████████ ██████ stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings. The owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago. So they hire the fake preacher (█████ ██████) to track down the murderess, who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name. The preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives.<br /><br />██████ is always good. Hayden is good the the slimy preacher, and █████ O'Neill is good as the father. Everyone else is just awful. █████ McKeller wins no sympathy (crucial for the role), █████ █████ is a lousy actress, ███████ ███████ is OK but always looks old, ██████ ████ and ██████ ████████ have no parts, ███████ █████ is a dud as the boy friend, ████████ ███████ is miscast as the society mother, ██████ █████████ overacts as the station owner.<br /><br />This one comes in under an hour but is a pale copy of the original which boasted dynamic performances by ██████ ██ ████████, █████ ████████, ███████ █████, and █████ ███████. But it's always worth watching ██████.
