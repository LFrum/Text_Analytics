Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not an entirely successful one. The Ultimate Challenge, is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as with a lot of the early Mania's, there's too much filler in between. The crowd pops for almost everything, and as always, giving us the reliable announcing team of ███████&The Body. Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania, was absolutely unheard of at this time, it only made things that much more tense. <br /><br />Matches. <br /><br />Koko B. Ware/W ███████ ██ "The Model" ████ ██████. For a 3 or so minute match, this is as good as it gets. I wish it was a tad longer, but what I got, was pretty damn good. Martel wins, with the Boston Crab.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />WWF Tag Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection|C|/W █████ █████. HUGE ███ for Demolition. Match itself is pretty dull, I often had trouble paying attention. █████ really didn't do much, so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1. There is solid talent involved here, and it's a shame they couldn't produce better. Demolition wins that titles, with there Pattened maneuver off the top. █████ blows the roof of for the finish.<br /><br />1 1/2 /5<br /><br />██████████/W █████ ████. Vs Hercules I got what I expected here, a standard boring filler match, with ██████████ doing his thing. I'm not really a fan of either, so It didn't perk my interest much. Quake wins with his sit down splash.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />██████ ████████ ██ Mr.Pefect/W The Genius. Deafening pop for █████. Really good match up, with sadly not enough time given to develop even further. It really kept my interest, and remains one of my favorites on the card. Beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post, much to the crowd's approval.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />Roddy █████ ██ ███ ████ █████. HUGE pop for █████. Nothing more than a boring brawl, that does not know what it wants to be. Some entertaining antics from The Hot Rod, but nothing else. Noteworthy for Roddy painting himself half black, and calling himself "███ █████"<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />The Hart Foundation Vs The Bolsheviks. Record breaking, but other than that, nothing to see here. Harts win with, The Hart Attack.<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />The Barbarian/W █████ ██████. Vs ████ Santana. Average for the time it got, but watchable nonetheless. █████ was rather dead for it, except for ██████'s interference. Jessie's hilarious cracks, about ████'s food is more entertaining, then the match itself. Barbarian wins with a nasty looking, flying clothesline off the top.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Mixed Tag Match. █████&Sapphire/W █████████. Vs █████ ████&Sherri. Big pop for █████, and an even bigger one for █████████, who looks absolutely stunning, might I add. I thought it was OK. It was lively at least, if nothing that great. I'm not a fan of █████' so. █████ and Sapphire win, when She rolls up Sherri.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />The Orient Express/W ████. Vs The Rockers. █████ is rather anemic for this, surprisingly. Decent no doubt, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. The constant focus with ████, kinda detracts from the match. Express wins by count out, when ███████ gets nailed with salt.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />███ ██████ ██ ████ █████/W ██████████&█████ ████. ██████ like an idiot, brings out The American flag in Canada. ██████ gets some solid boo's for it too, but that also may be due to █████'s Canadian heritage. Crappy match all around, I don't care for ██████, but that's not why it sucked. Too short in the end, to really matter. ██████ wins when he whacks █████ in the back, with the two by four. ██████ gets splashed for his troubles.<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />███████ ██████ ████████████. ███ Dibiase|C|/W Virgil. Vs Jake Robers/W Damien. Some slow spots, but when all was said and done, I had a good time. Two solid wrestlers giving it there all, resulted in an entertaining match up. █████ noticeably gets ████ during parts of it though, by doing the wave. Dibiase wins by count out. Jake has the last laugh, by giving away some of his money, much to the crowd's delight.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />Big Bossman Vs █████/W Slick. Nice pop for The Bossman. Too routine, and too short to really mean anything, in the end. █████ was a gimmick, I was never too fond of. Bossman wins with his slam.<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />The Rhythm&█████ segment was pretty much a failure. █████ wasn't into it<br /><br />████ Rude/W █████ ██████. Vs █████ █████. For a filler match, before the main event, this wasn't too bad. If it had time to get going more, it would have been excellent, for sure. Rude wins, with the Rude Awakening.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Title For Title. Ultimate ███████|IC Champ| Vs Hulk Hogan|WWF Champ| This one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd, and the split crowd reaction, for the most part. ███████ got a pretty decent pop, but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming. Hogan dwarfs it completely,with his. It's one of Wrestlemania's best matches in history. With two people, who aren't really known for there wrestling, they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages. I have seen this many times, and my respect level grows higher for each one, for their effort, considering i'm not a fan of either. Even die-hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling, can't bitch about this one!. ███████ wins with his splash. <br /><br />5/5<br /><br />Bottom line. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry, if nothing overly special. It's memorable for the main event, the location, and the crowd, but it's not one of the best if you ask me. That being said I do enjoy it, and I give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans.<br /><br />7/10
