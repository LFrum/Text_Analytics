A really funny British comedy from the mid 1950's about a school for girls. The girls are all involved in mischief and mayhem, making bathtub gin, smoking and gambling. ████████ ███ plays Headmistress █████████ in a glorious drag role, as well as playing █████████'s brother. A female police officer goes to the school undercover to see what is going on. This film is funny, having great sight gags and ████████ ███ is great. Just a classic Britsh comedy, lots of fun and not too cruse. ████ Sims ans ███ █████, stars of many █████ On films, play small roles, but this film is about the girls. It spawned 3 sequels and a recent re-make. Watch and enjoy where it all began.
