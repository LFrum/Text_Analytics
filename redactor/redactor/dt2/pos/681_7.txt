Intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house (██████, excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner (████). The 2 masters of the genre are at their heady, erotic best as they match wits, emotions, and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the Saturday Evening Post. ██████ hued B & W photography with an unusual amount of close-up head shots. The young girl who teases ████ is really well directed here. Improbable, but satisfying suburban melodrama.
