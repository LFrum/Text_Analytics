RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt all warm and tingly when ███████ █████ (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of █████ ██████████) set out to get revenge on the princess (voice of ██████ ███████). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. To me, she deserved to have ███████ █████ and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting. In addition, I thought that Lurky (voiec of ███ ██████) and Murky (voiec of █████ ██████) were diabolical. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who hasn't seen it, especially die-hard fans of the TV series. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.
