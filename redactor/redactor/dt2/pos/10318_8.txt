A Three Stooges short, this one featuring █████. Of all those involving █████ I've seen, this is my favorite performance by him in a Stooges short. The basic plot is that █████ must get married by 6 o'clock that very evening if he's to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will. So █████ sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected, that is until they learn of his inheritance money. Best bits here involve █████ shaving, █████ and Moe in a telephone booth and █████ on piano as accompaniment to █████'s voice-training session. Also the sequence where █████ is mistaken as ██████ █████ and its outcome proves hilarious.
