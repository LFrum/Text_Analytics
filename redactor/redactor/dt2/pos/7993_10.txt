I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked ██████ forever back then but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't date when I grew up. I did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'Hhmm... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes from?' Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway!'<br /><br />The original ███ ██████ ██████ was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and I didn't like all the actors. This movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more Gothic style and no involvement of Prince. <br /><br />Nowadays, many fans of the Christopher █████ movies dislike Burton claiming that the █████ movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. I don't think this is entirely true: -There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of ██████ which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -██████ has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with ██████ & █████). A director is free to choose what kind of ██████ he's going to portray as long if it's good.<br /><br />My opinion: ██████ doesn't necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.<br /><br />I just recently watched the █████ movies and I love those ones as well (especially The Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me more. █████'s goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of ██████. That's a bit too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of ██████. The Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.<br /><br />My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the █████ with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors.
