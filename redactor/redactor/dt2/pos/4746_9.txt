███ Scheider is not █████ ███████ or █████ ████████ but then who is? The Seven-Ups is one of the better cop movies, even today, and is second only to McQueen's ███████ and the █████ █████ series, which isn't bad company. There are three things that seem to make a good cop movie: Believable script with great acting, great car chase scenes, and some heavy action. This movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than that in █████ █████. Scheider plays the head of a group of cops out to get NY's bad guys sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name Seven-Ups. Overall, not quite up to █████ █████ or ███████ but far better than all of the cop movies made since the █████ █████ series. 9/10.
