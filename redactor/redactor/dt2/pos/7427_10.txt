This movie is a hidden gem. I can't understand why this movie doesn't get more air time. █████ and ███████ ██████ make for a real attractive and dashing couple. And their chemistry is impeccable. I really liked the touch of his daughters reference to him as being her █████ ████. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys █████ █████. It's nice to see █████ playing a father as well. By all accounts from his very own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. Also, the supporting cast is wonderful as well. You can't go wrong with supporting players such as ██████ ████████ and ██████ ██████. ██████ ████████ makes a movie that much better from the get-go. This movie has now become a Holiday tradition in my home. Enjoy!!!
