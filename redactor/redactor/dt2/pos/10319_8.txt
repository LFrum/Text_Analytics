For the record, I am a █████ fan through and through. But I do have to say that in reality, █████ wasn't really that bad. Yeah, he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that █████ had, but in his own way he was hilarious. At least he wasn't as bad as ███ Besser.<br /><br />In BRIDELESS GROOM, █████ plays a music professor (██████? A professor? Yeah right), who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle, and ███ & █████ have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock that night, or no money.<br /><br />This was one of the ██████s' first skit with █████, before they started recycling their material. Perhaps it isn't surprising that █████ was part of the ██████s before █████ came into the picture, so he seemed natural at this. The slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this one scene with ███ and █████ in a phone booth. Essential ██████ short to be honest.
