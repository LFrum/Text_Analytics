Great party movie, following the adventures of ████ & ███, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. ████ (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend ███ (█████ ████) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When ████ moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend ███ moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn ████'s life upside down. This movie is non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. Soundtrack features guitar virtioso ██████ ███ █████ throughout the movie, also features cameos by rockers ███ ████ and ███ ████. 70s Pornstar legend ██████ ███████ also makes an appearance! Classic 80s movie is worth multiple looks. Now all that needs to be done is a much anticipated DVD release! If you enjoyed this movie, take a look at "The Last American Virgin" which is similar to "████ ████". I rate both highly.
