At the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who ███████ ████████ was parodying.Today only some women over 50 probably remember ██████ █████,whose column "█████████ ██████" ran in Family Circle Magazine from before World War II until the 1970's.She lived on Stillmeadow Farm in Conecticut,and her columns were collected into a number of books,███████████ ███████, ███████████ ███████, etc. The lines that ███████ ████████ recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical ██████ █████ column.Besides cooking and country living,she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times.She talked a lot about her favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels.You might say that ██████ ███████ is the Gladys Tabor of today.<br /><br />Christmas is Connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece,but it is pleasant,lighthearted entertainment,soothing to the stressed out mind,and that is good enough
