██████ ████████ wanted to make this movie for 15 years, and finally found █████ ████ to play the title role. ████ is amazing in his portrayal of ███ ███████. From an interview I saw with ████, he met ███████ several times and the two of them also played piano together (████ had piano lessons as a young child and actually played piano in all his scenes). I didn't see ███████ live until his later years, so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed. I hope ████ gets nominated for the Best Actor Oscar as he certainly deserves it. The music, also, is incredible - it really showcases the breadth of ███████' music, from country to blues, and everything in between. The movie also gives an unblemished account of ███ ███████' life, from the many women he had relationships with to his drug habit and the consequences of that.
