██ █████ ██████ is unique in a lot of ways. First this is ███ ███████'s (████ ███) first action film. Second She was actually doing the fight scenes after having a surgery done to her a few days before filming. Third this movie is off the chain.<br /><br />The movie starts out with ████ ████ ███ trying to take the inheritance from his brother. His brother then has ████ to marry him so ████ can't take the treasure. The story is pretty good leading everything to it's rightful place.<br /><br />In comes the action, what can I say that hasn't already been said for movies like this, or Disciples of the 36th Chambers, The Victim, or even the Magnificent Butcher. The fight scenes are what sales movie, and this one won't have any problem doing so. ███ Chia Liang and ████ ████ ███ engaged in a fight that you have to see to believe. Why have these two men not fought each other more is beyond me.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything really, but you have to see ██ █████ ██████ to get the full blast of excitement. My only gripe is that ████ ███ was not used as broad as he was used in 3 Evil Masters, or even Invincible Pole Fighter (8 ███████ ████ ███████) to excellent must see movies. 9.2/10
