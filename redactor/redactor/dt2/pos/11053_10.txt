█████'s first spoken words in this 1930 film electrified audiences and became part of Hollywood legend. █████ had become a star in her first American film, The Torrent, in 1926. And audiences waited til this film to see if █████ could make the transition to talkies. She did. And while ████ █████, █████ █████, and █████ ██████ fell by the wayside because of their accents, █████ sailed on for another decade. Despite the staginess of this film, █████ is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great █████ ████████ as ██████. The two great stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film. █████ was 25; ████████ was 60. ███████ Bickford is OK as ████, and ██████ ██ ██████ is good as Old Chris. ██████ originated this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with ███████ █████. This Eugene O'Neill play is a true classic yet, oddly, was never filmed again. ████ Christie ranks as one of █████'s greatest performances. And despite the staginess of the film and the grimness of the story, she is truly a marvel. See this one for █████ and ████████!
