This film held my interest enough to watch it several times. The plot has holes, but the lead performers make it work.<br /><br />█████████ ████ ███████ (█████ █████████), does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician. She worked years to earn the money to go to medical school. She is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream.<br /><br />Meanwhile, █████'s sister and brother-in-law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece ██████ (█████ Aguayo-Stewart) to avoid having her become a ward of the state. ██████ is about 7 years old from her appearance. ██████ is so traumatized from her parent's murder that she has become mute. Needless to say, █████'s 16-hour days get longer caring for ██████.<br /><br />███ ████ plays █████ ██████, a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of █████ and ██████. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help ██████ deal with her distress. ██████ really starts to warm up to █████ as the film progresses, perhaps more than to her aunt. █████ starts to rely on █████ to take some of the load of caring for ██████ as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination. █████ is always there whenever some crisis erupts for █████.<br /><br />The chemistry between ███ and █████████ ████ was great. You keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film. The chemistry between ███ and █████ was good as well. █████ managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words. The plot had █████ and ██████ gradually warming up to each other. You can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses.<br /><br />We discover that █████'s sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft. █████ discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities. The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed.<br /><br />In any case the Meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates. The killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them. The killers search the home and fail to find their prize. They leave a living witness to their crime, ██████. The killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from █████ and ██████ who have no idea where the prize is located. Eventually, the killers kidnap ██████ in hopes she knows something about the microchip's location.<br /><br />Eventually █████ discovers the truth about █████. He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. After some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue ██████ and dispatch the bad guys. The predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together.<br /><br />What struck me about the plot were major holes. █████ moves into the same apartment building as █████ and ██████ the day after the murder of the Meyers. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? The killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene, with no concern for concealing their identity. The killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to ██████ by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles. He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. There are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention.<br /><br />The film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming. Filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort.
