WrestleMania 6 took place April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, ███████, Canada.<br /><br />█████ 1: ████ ██████ vs. ████ ██ ████ - For what it was, a very solid opening match. ████ was always fairly popular with the fans, and at this point ██████ was still getting over as a heel talent. In the end ██████ is able to snag the win in a pretty non memorable match.<br /><br />█████ 2: The Colossal Connection (█████ The Giant & ████) (c) (with █████ 'The █████' ██████) vs Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Tag Team Championship - At this point █████'s health was really awful, so his performance was really nothing special. The crowd is 100% pro Demolition in this match. In the end ████ is pinned and we have New Tag Team Champions. After the match █████ lays out ████ and ██████ and turns face at what would turn out to be his last WrestleMania.<br /><br />█████ 3: Earthquack vs ████████ - Very short match. Big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. R.I.P. to both men in the match. ████ Tenta (Earthquake) passed not that long ago and same with ████████. In the end Earthquake pins ████████ for the win.<br /><br />█████ 4: Mr. Perfect vs ██████ "The Barber" Beefcake - The first really good match of the night. R.I.P. to ████ ███████ (Mr. Perfect). Really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys. In the end ██████ gets the win thanks to a lot of his major fan support during the match.<br /><br />█████ 5: 'Rowdy' █████ █████ vs Bad News Brown - Not a technical classic, but a pretty decent brawl for WrestleMania. Piper comes out half black/half white in what is considerably a classic moment. In the end both guys fight to a double count out with no clear cut winner.<br /><br />█████ 6: The ████ Foundation vs The Bolsheviks - Complete squash match. The ████ Foundation gets an easy win. Surprising that WWE used to have a tag team division.<br /><br />█████ 7: The Barbarian vs ████ ███████ - █████ ██████'s "██████ ██████" fairs better in this match as The Barbarian takes the win against ████ ███████. Not memorable, but good to go back and watch years later.<br /><br />█████ 8: █████ ██████ & Sensational Sherri vs █████ ██████ & Sapphire - Big inter-gender tag team match. █████ ██████ wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit out to the ring. In the end ██████ and Sapphire get the win over "The Macho King" and Sensational Queen Sherri.<br /><br />█████ 9: The Rockers vs The Orient Express - Surprisingly another tag team match. Tag wrestling used to be so much better during this time period. A young █████ ████████ and his partner █████ ████████ take a loss by count out in this match to the Orient Express.<br /><br />█████ 10: ████ █████ vs ███ ██████ - ██████ gets a decent reaction, despite his American Patriot gimmick. Bravo, a member of █████ ████'s group, comes to the ring with ████ and Earthquake. Although he has support, ██████ takes the win.<br /><br />█████ 11: "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase (c) vs ████ 'The █████' ███████ for the Million Dollar Championship - The first major main event of the night. ███████ was extremely over with the fans. █████ was considerably good for what it was. DiBiase is able to pick up a count out win on ███████. But ███████ ends up possessing DiBiase's money and giving it away.<br /><br />█████ 12: The Big ████ Man vs █████ (with █████) - One Man ████'s sad attempt at being an African Dream named █████. A really short match that needed some more time to develop itself as a match. ████ Man wins with a slam.<br /><br />█████ 13: █████ "Superfly" Snuka vs ████ ████ - ██████ comes to the ring with ████ for this match. Snuka, never really got it good at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be on the losing end. After a short 5 minutes, ████ gets the win over Snuka.<br /><br />█████ 14: WWF Champion ████ █████ vs Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Dubbed as "The Ultimate Challenge" we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night. The match was actually very good, given that people tend to think █████ can't wrestle. A lot of near falls that really got the crowd and people that watch at home into it. In the end Warrior gets the win on █████ and wins both titles. A stunned crowd looks on as ████ █████ suffers his first loss at WrestleMania.
