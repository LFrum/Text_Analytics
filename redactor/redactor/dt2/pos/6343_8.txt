I had my reservations about watching The Return to ████████ ████ after seeing and enjoying the original so much. Without █████ ███ █████ reprising his role as ███████ ████ or Anjelica Huston as █████, I figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough. Upon viewing 'return' I can honestly say it's a worthy successor. The actors really make the show with ███ ██████, ████ ████████, and ██████ ████ all preforming at their very best. I admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first, but 'return' definitely has it's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have. Anyone who still has reservations can rest assured that The Return to ████████ ████ succeeds in capturing the 'feel' of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and check it out, ██' Gus would be proud!
