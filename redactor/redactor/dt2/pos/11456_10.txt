I love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie. Not just because I'm a huge ██████ Quigley-████ Terashita fan, but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times.<br /><br />The special effects are awesome, especially ██████'s scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed.<br /><br />Plenty of nudity provided by ██████ and ████, plenty of humor, cool soundtrack, high body count, etc...By the way, if you have never seen this one, try and buy/watch the Unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing.
