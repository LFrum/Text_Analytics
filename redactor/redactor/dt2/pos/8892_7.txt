The college teacher █████ ██████ (█████ ███████) is a blocked writer since his former wife █████████ (Kate Mulgrew) ruined him, stealing his novel that became a best-seller. He does not hide his hatred for █████████, upsetting his girlfriend ████ ████ (███ ██████), who is an anthropologist teacher in the same college. While giving classes of Creative Writing, he is stalked by the student ████ (█████ ██████) that wants to know his opinion about his crime tale. █████ tells that he did not like it, and explains that in every mystery tale, the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he would get caught. Further, █████ suggests ████ to watch █████████'s movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story. ████, who wants to kill his detestable mother (████ ██████), watches "Strangers on a Train" and misunderstands █████'s advice, believing that his teacher wants to swap murders to eliminate the motive. ████ travels to Hawaii and while in a ship, █████████ falls overboard vanishing in the sea and is considered dead. However, █████ does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect, while the deranged ████ presses him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal.<br /><br />"█████ █████ from the Train" is one of the funniest comedies of the 80's and a great tribute to ██████ █████████. The direct reference is "Strangers on a Train", but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with the spinning camera), "Family Plot" (with the car without breaks) and other movies. The lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when █████ tells that every great romance or mystery has a train. ████ ██████ is amazing in the role of a nasty and abusive dominating mother and the viewer will certainly feel sorrow and understand the insanity of ████. ███ ██████ is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. █████ ███████ performs an obsessed character with many silly and unreasonable attitudes but necessary to the plot. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Jogue a Mamãe do ████" ("█████ █████ from the Train")
