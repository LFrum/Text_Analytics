████ and Kate meet the physician ██████ ██████ first and then the psychics █████ ███████ and they demonstrate that have not come to the island with the intention of rescuing the survivors. Locke and his group find the anthropologist █████████ ███████ █████, and ███ █████ shoots her. Meanwhile, the group of ████ finds the pilot █████ ███████, who landed the helicopter with minor damages that can be repaired. ████ forces █████ to tell the real intention why they have come to the island.<br /><br />The second episode of the Fourth Season returns to the island, with four new characters, stops the confusing "flash-forwards" and it seems that will finally be the beginning of the explanations that I (and most of the fans and viewers) expect to be provided in "Lost". Why the interest of the government in ███ █████, and how he is informed from the boat are some of the questions that I expect to see in the next episodes. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available
