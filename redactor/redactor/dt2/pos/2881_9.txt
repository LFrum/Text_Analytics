██████████ ████ ███████'s (Look Back in Anger, The Entertainer) dramatisation of █████ █████'s only novel positively revels in the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much so. Nonetheless, the dialogue, the acting, with a cast headed by ███ ████ ███████ & ██████ █████, and the brilliantly cerebral production (marred only by a "too quick" ending) make this worth the while of any lover of Theater, with a capital "T".
