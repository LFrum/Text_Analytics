I first saw this one when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really managed to scare me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of that whole feeling from a videotaped suspense story (the same thing that helped ████ ███████ itself). And the casting was so right. I hardly know █████ ██████ from anything else, so it might not be so right to call HIM "well-cast," but to me, he IS ██████ ████. And as far as the other male actors, the one who fit his part so well was █████ █████████ (who's so good at "larger than life" characters) as ███ █████. And ████ ██████, a sort of ███ ██████ "repertory player" at the time, because of ████ ███████. As one poster points out, this version manages to include the involvements with men, in a fairly subtle way. The scene where Dorian recites a list of men's names to ████ ██████'s character, as a way of blackmailing him, and the look on ██████'s face, were very well-done. (If that scene were done now, it would probably be done in a TOO OBVIOUS way, and be bad by comparison.) I saw it when "██████ ████" was barely a name to me, let alone more, so even more than the famous 1945 version (which is rightly famous), this is THE version to me.
