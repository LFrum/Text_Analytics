█████ ███████'s best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film, I love it. The film itself has gorgeous cinematography, and fine realisation of the subject matter. The ending is enough to have you in tears, as it is so beautifully done. Lionel has directed some truly excellent films, like the Amazing Mr Blunden, but this is his best film as director by a mile. The costumes were absolutely lovely, that matched the beauty of the countryside, and the sparkling and conveniently-faithful script helped matters. However, it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together, as it is nothing shorter than incredible. █████ Sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother, a much-needed characteristic of the character, and ███████ ████████ was hilarious as █████. In fact, I preferred █████ on film, as he isn't as humorous in the book. The children were perfect. ████ Warren and █████ ████████ both gave spirited performances, but it is █████ ███████'s enchanting portrayal of ██████ that impressed me the most. Another special mention is the gorgeous music by ██████ ███████, the title music reminded me of ███████ ███████'s Smile. In conclusion, a funny and poignant masterpiece, that is better than the book, I think. 10/10. ███████ Cox.
