Fans of █████ ████████'s productions will recognise several actors and vehicles from UFO (which was made after ████████████) - as well as sound effects from various ████████ series. █████ ████'s excellent music (mostly unique to this film) adds to the feeling of familiarity. For these reasons alone, I think any █████ ████████ fan would find ████████████ worth getting.<br /><br />Judged simply as a film, it has to be said that ████████████ is flawed. It is known that there were major problems during production, and I suspect this is why there is a time-consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story. Presumably time/budget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging!<br /><br />Distractingly, the special effects range from outstandingly good - better than any 1960s film that I know of - to disappointingly bad. <br /><br />Nevertheless, even with these flaws, ████████████'s main story is well told and keeps the viewer (or, at least, this viewer) engaged throughout. The ending is perhaps not what one might expect from ████████, yet at the same time it is typical of ████████, and it is certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean you'll have to watch it for yourself. :)
