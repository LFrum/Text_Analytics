██████ █████████ shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 British film, "The Man ███ ████ ███ Much". This 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one. ███ █████████ was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next, thus keeping a standard in his work. ██████ █████ did an excellent job with the cinematography and ██████ ████████'s editing shows his talent. Ultimately, ███████ ████████ is seen conducting at the magnificent Royal ██████ ████ in London at the climax of the picture.<br /><br />█████ ███████ was an actor that worked well with ███ █████████. In this version, he plays a doctor from Indiana on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they are on their way to █████████ in one local bus and the intrigue begins. His wife is the lovely █████ Day at her best. She had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother. The film has some good supporting cast, ██████ ████████, ███████ █████, ██████ █████, ████ ███████, among others, do a great job in portraying their characters.<br /><br />Although this is a "light █████████", one can't dismiss it as a failure. "The Man ███ ████ ███ Much" is a change of pace for █████████'s fans.
