████ █████'s best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, ███ ██████ (one of the crickets) and ███████ ██████ █████ as well.<br /><br />An 8 out of 10. Best performance = ████ █████. Thankfully, ███ █████ was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to ███ ██████ in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by ███ █████. I hope this made plenty of dough. █████ was never this popular again for varying reasons, but thankfully he has this one great one on his resume.
