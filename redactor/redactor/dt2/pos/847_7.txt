Ok, everybody agreed on what was the best season. The first. And killing off █████ was a bad desicion. Also killing off others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Still it's easy to accept ████ as the new main character, if you are over █████. He is really... mysterious. The thing that shocked me most was when █████ was written out of the story and how. That was something she didn't deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde chick called █████, with absolutely no character! But these Taelons stay mysterious, and you stay wondering about theyre true plans till the end. ████ Suspence. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant.<br /><br />I understand that, when you jump in on an episode from the 3th,4th or 5th season, you may not understand this show. But when you watch from the beginning, you just cant break loose!<br /><br />The acting is great, the special FX are marvellous, the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing. Gotta see this, guys!
