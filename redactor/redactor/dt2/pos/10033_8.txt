The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds. █████ █████ was never better as this role was tailored for him. Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful. ██████ ███████ never more villainous. ███████ █████ never more noble than as █████ █████. It had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout. The one historical aspect I found most glaringly inaccurate was the final "Last Stand" which occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn. The film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight. However, I still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of Hollywood's golden age.
