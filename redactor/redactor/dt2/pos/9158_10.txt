As I recall, my family made a point to stay home on the night "███████" was on (Mondays? Tuesdays? NBC?). It was a superb vehicle for █████ ██████, very well written, great ensemble cast. His character very much like the "███████ ████ █████..." films: Retired gambler with mysterious past settles into town and has adventures every week. In fact, it seemed fairly obvious that it was the same character. It was just a charmer of a TV show. A sleeper, like "My World And ███████ To It", which may have been its contemporary--I forget. I dearly wish these shows would be made available on DVD. It was Just Good TV. Perhaps "███████ ██████ Jr." come close, but only by a mile.
