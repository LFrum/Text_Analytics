A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class ███████ at it's best. Some great acting by ███ █████████ and █████ ██████. ███ █████████ is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. █████ ██████ is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, ██████ ████████ did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the ███████ middle class. The films pace does not falter although it is not a faced paced film. A good twist in the plot, that is not predictable A lovely ███████ country village setting. I enjoyed this film very much The locations were also very well selected. If you enjoy films about relationships this is one to watch. Better to have some tissues ready!
