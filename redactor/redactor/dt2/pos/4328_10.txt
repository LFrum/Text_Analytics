████, ██████ and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with ████ to surprise "The Others" in case ███████ is double-crossing the group. ████ Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by ███ ███, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.<br /><br />This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of "Lost" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans. In the USA, the air date of this episode was 24 May 2006. Therefore, along this period, fans have to wait for the Third Season in a very suspenseful situation, with ████ and his group surrounded by "The Others" and finding the truth about ███████ and the death of ███ █████ and Libby; ████ locked inside the hatch without the intention of pushing the button and ███ ███ in despair outside the hatch. I hope the fate of "Lost" be better than "Angel" and its very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available
