'█████' is a nice surprise: A romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not funny or romantic. '█████' takes actors like ████ █████, █████ █████, and ███ ██████ into a fun, light-as-a-feather journey that actually had me laughing and, yes, a little "aww, how sweet!".<br /><br />Meet ████ ████████ (████ █████), aka █████. He's a self-proclaimed 'Date ██████'; he helps hopeless guys like ██████ (█████ █████) win guys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, █████ has to deal with █████ (███ ██████), a gossip columnist bent on breaking the Date ██████...<br /><br />'█████' is actually pretty funny, and it even makes the standard slapstick scenes work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly having fun. I have to wonder why ████ █████ hasn't made more movies like this. His sharp, rapid-fire delivery is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with ██████ and █████ is wonderful. █████ is a real discovery; I have never seen his show 'The King of Queens', but he is funny and heartfelt, and he proves once more that fat white men cannot dance hip-hop (█████'s responses to his attempts are hilarious). ██████ is hot and bouncy (not that way, geez) as █████'s perfect match, and Amber Valletta is sweet as Allegra.<br /><br />'█████' isn't perfect; it's a tad too long, and things get too "dramatic" near the end (although this is redeemed by the happy ending filled with funny dancing). But's it a great refresher from the cookie-cutter romantic comedies that keep littering theaters.
