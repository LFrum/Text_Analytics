I was never in the past interested in this play although love ███████████ and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. I never bothered to try to see ██████ until fairly recently deciding I should at least try to watch it and I borrowed the ███████ version from the library. Well, I struggled with it. ███████ seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part. The play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and I think must have missed out too much as I found it difficult to concentrate on it, soon became bored and annoyed by it. I still think ███████'s █████ █ is the best version I've seen of that rousing play - tho' admit I haven't rewatched the Beeb version yet and can't recall how it was when first shown.<br /><br />I heard of the ███████ full length version of ██████. Although I enjoyed his Much Ado, I think the Beeb version is far better and I wasn't entirely impressed by his █████ █. But I was off ███████ a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of Love's Labour's Lost which is a play I like and was so well made by the Beeb. <br /><br />Finally acquiring the complete ████ ███████████ on DVD recently, I soon rewatched one of my most favourite ███████████ plays, ███████ ██, and was simply enthralled by ██████ in the part so was immediately persuaded to watch his ██████ next. What a revelation this play now is for me! Yes, it is splendid, but I feel it needs an actor you can emphathise with to play ██████ and this for me is ██████. Amazing. Intriguing to note that although he is older than I understand the character ██████ was, it doesn't show whilst in ███████ it did. Now I note he's also in the ███████ version and had much to do with training ███████, so I shall have to watch that to see what ██████ does with ████████! I'm interested to discover ██████ has trained ███████ as yes, you can certainly see the influence.<br /><br />And now I'm going to watch it all over again....
