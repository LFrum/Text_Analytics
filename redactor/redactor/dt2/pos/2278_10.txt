You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like ███ ███████, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. ███████ plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?) to Japan as his career winds down. Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Great supporting performances by ███████'s manager ("Japan's █████ ████████"), his girl friend █████████, and his interpreter. The chemistry between ███████ and █████████ works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball. Look for ████████ as fellow player well before he became a persistent shill for Allstate. Movie wraps up very nicely. Easily in my top fifty all time movies and maybe my favorite one on baseball.
