A true comedy.The dialog is fast and very witty.Eleanor ██████ at her physical peak .█████ as only █████ can be"the charming rogue'..although now past his prime.. Most of the scenes between the principals are short so the movie moves well. If you haven't seen this movie please give a look.You will be surprised at █████'s comedy timing.The scenes between him ██████, ██████ and "Cudddles" Sakal are hilarious.Just on the basis of the outfits worn by the most attractive ██████,this movie is worth a look.The romance of this 40's movie will not be lost on those so inclined to watch movies from Hollywood's golden past. My bet is that █████ ███ ███████ won't disappoint.
