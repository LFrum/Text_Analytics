I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than ███████ █████████'s. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know █████████, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as █████████ ████ and ████ ███████. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, █████████ has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since ████ ███████ and thankfully so.<br /><br />We know the story, a WWII tale told only as █████████ can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. ████ ████ as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in ████ occupied France. Their goal - killin' ████'s. █████████ █████ as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the "Jew Hunter" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, ████████ ███████, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about █████████ or his films, this is nothing new for him.<br /><br />War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other █████████ films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by ████ ████. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were ███████ ███████ and █████████ █████, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.<br /><br />The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. █████████ wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but ████ ███████ remains his masterpiece.<br /><br />███████ █████████ among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but █████████ some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. ███ packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain █████████ style, it's worth being checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of ███████ █████████.
