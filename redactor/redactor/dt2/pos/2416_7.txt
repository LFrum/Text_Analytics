This film was very different form the previous films and I had to wonder, "Where is █████ ███████?" he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as ██████'s old friend who teaches █████ what he already knows, then ██████ can come along and add some more! Macchio could've been the love interest for █████ in this film! Never mind!<br /><br />On a serious level, I enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different to what ██████'s were. █████ is much more wild than ██████ was and needs taming, something which ██████ finds very challenging; she's quite a troubled girl and a rude, obnoxious brat!<br /><br />It was very satisfying to watch the transformation in █████ as she warms to ██████ and gets to understand more about Karate and her life in general. We can all learn a thing or two from ██████'s witticisms!
