Here we have the inimitable ███████ ███████ forsaking his slapstick past to tackle the serious subject of anti-Semitism, and intolerance in general. He portrays two characters - the sweet, innocent Jewish barber - a war veteran, and the raving and ruthless dictator, ███████ ██████. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to the whims of ██████ and his armed thugs, who routinely rough up its residents, or leave them alone, dependent upon his mood that day or week. The barber is among them, but is befriended by his former commanding officer, ███████ (████████ ███████), who seems to keep things quiet for a while, until ██████ condemns him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, most specifically the barber, and the feisty young woman, Hannah (████████ ███████). The premise will be - who will be the one among these Jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of ██████ and his cronies? We needn't guess too hard to know the answer; the barber is a dead ringer for the dictator, and he is outfitted in his image, accompanied by ███████, also in full military gear. Hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to the country of Osterlich, where Mr ███████'s (███████ █████████) cousin has a farm, and they can live peaceably for a while. At this point, ██████ himself has been arrested by his armed forces, thinking him to be the notorious barber. The latter, meanwhile, has been escorted with ███████ to a podium, to make a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The ensuing ten minutes is pure ███████ himself, speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrating greed and hatred. ██████ ███████ started production on the film in 1937, it can be forgiven some naivete. He was allegedly unaware of the gravity of this persecution and hatred, and said had he known the full extent, he would never have made the film, because he most likely believed it would have trivialized the situation. He has a marvelous supporting cast: ████████ ███████, █████ ███████ as █████████, his aide-de-camp, the always wonderful █████ ███████ as the bumbling Herring, ████████ ███████, ████ █████ as the dictator ████████, his rival for conquest, veteran European actors █████ ██████ (███'s father), ███████ █████████, among others. The scene he choreographed with globe, with just a musical accompaniment is sheer, luminous inspiration, and luminous, as well, is ████████ ███████ at the film's end, smiling through her tears. I have seen this film before, but there is always something new in it for me. Last evening, when it finished, I sat there in tears. I defy anyone not to be moved by it.
