One of ██████ █████████'s three greatest films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On A Train" is as brilliantly out-of-control as a merry-go-round in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. It's the kind of film you have so much fun watching, you can't even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath.<br /><br />Top amateur tennis contender ███ ██████ (██████ ███████) meets a singularly weird, louche stranger named █████ ███████ (██████ ██████) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, █████ knows all about ███'s problems with his no-good wife ██████, and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor: █████ will kill ██████ and ███ will kill █████'s father, who wants to put █████ in an institution. ███ laughs it off, but █████ ain't kidding, as ███ finds out to his peril.<br /><br />It's a great premise for a murder story, and █████████ gives "Strangers On A Train" a run for all its worth, with the help of ██████ in perhaps the greatest performance in any █████████ film, including ███████ ███████ in "Psycho". While ███████ makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain, ██████ as ███████ is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park.<br /><br />What drives █████? Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty ███. Yes, █████ lights up the old gay-dar, but ███ seems happy enough on love's rebound with socialite ████ ██████ (████ █████). █████'s interest for ███ could just as easily be envy, for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home, letting █████ file his nails.<br /><br />"Oh, I certainly admire people who do things," █████ purrs, looking like a cat eyeing a mouse. "You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important."<br /><br />Later on, █████ calls himself a "bum", accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him, even as he wrecks ███'s life with his homicidal meddling. It's the ultimate perverse underdog's tale. There's a sense of integrity about █████, in his dogged dedication, which commands our respect and which █████████ plays to so brilliantly. When █████ floats away from the scene of his big crime, am I the only sick person in this world who's actually happy for him? I think not, yet █████████ keeps the story on a right-enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen. We don't want █████ to win, exactly, but we enjoy his élan as he tries.<br /><br />Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. █████████ always managed at least 2-3 good setpiece sequences per movie; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. ("20 Big Shows" the neon side at the entrance says, and they aren't kidding.) Script, camera-work, a gripping tennis match, ████ █████'s jaw-dropping figure, it's all too much greatness for one film to contain. Even ███████ does his callow-youth thing here with more risible plausibility than ███████ ████ ever managed.<br /><br />You can call this a clinic in movie-making, but "clinic" sounds too dull. "Strangers On A Train" is good nasty fun, all the way through, leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along. Heck, I'll take that ride over again in a second!
