Last year, I fell in love with the Tim ██████'s version of ███████ ████ so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and I found this one at the library. Though I think ██████'s is best, probably because I like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. I haven't seen any of the other versions but I am trying to get my hands on them.<br /><br />After seeing ██████ ████ as ████, it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role, but ██████ █████ does a fantastic job. ██████ Lansbury is great, as always and all of the singing is fantastic. I found myself singing along. This is a play you won't want to miss, but try and see it before you see the film version so you won't have a biased view like me.
