████ LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When █████ (█████ ██████████) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (█████ ███████), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. ██████ ███████ and █████ ████ are the hit men who follow her.<br /><br />What █████ is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. █████ ██████ (Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. █████ isn't real, he's a soap opera character on the show `A Reason To ████' and he's really an egotistical actor named ██████ McCord.<br /><br />To say any more regarding what develops would be too much, but █████ █████ is certainly original. Its hit men are, like the hired killers of ████ ███████, are violent yet philosophical, its take on soap operas terrific spoof material, and its acting is the best feature of all. This has to be one of the best cast films in recent years. █████ ██████████ is perfect for █████ █████, with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest. ██████ ███████ brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career, and █████ ████ is his partner, a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actor/soap opera doctor. There are also great supporting performances from actors such as Emmy-winner ███████ ██████ (The West Wing), ███████ ██████ ██████ (███████'s agent ████ ██████), and ████████ ████████ (█████ on ER). Actually, the supporting cast is a Who's Who of television best character actors.<br /><br />A unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next, █████ █████ is a mix of great acting, casting, and a terrific screenplay.
