████ █████ is one of the few players in film history to have failed at his first big break and then succeed on the second time around. Of course everyone knows the second time was the classic Stagecoach with ████ ████ directing.<br /><br />But we're here to talk about The Big Trail. ████ ████'s fellow director █████ █████ spotted this tall kid on the set of one of Ford's films and thought he had potential. He wanted to make him the lead in a big budget western that ███ was planning to do. The film as planned would be an homage to the famous classic silent western The Covered Wagon.<br /><br />In watching The Big Trail I was struck by how similar █████'s character of █████ ███████ here is to the Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. Both characters were likable young cowpokes, but both were also on a mission of vengeance. And of course both films were done on location and show the expense in making them. No studio product here with a backlot western set. <br /><br />I also don't think that it was an accident that █████ got this break at the beginning of the sound era. █████ █████, I'm guessing looked around Hollywood and probably didn't think a whole lot of movie cowboys would have staying power in sound. That's something else █████ spotted in █████.<br /><br />According to what I've read The Big Trail flopped because after spending all that money to make the film in an early wide screen process, some genius at ███ realized that their theaters weren't equipped with the wide screen to show it. And when the Great Depression hit there would be no money to widen those screens at ███ movie houses. So The Big Trail got a limited release, even in what we would call a formatted version, and lost money big for ███ films.<br /><br />Marguerite █████████ is fine as the crinoline heroine who ████ wins, loses and wins again from ███ █████. Keith, ███████ ███████ and F. ██████ █████ are the trio of villains █████ has to deal with.<br /><br />F. ██████ █████ is the father of the famous movie legend ██████ █████. He was a big burly man with a grand background in classic roles on screen and on stage. I wouldn't be surprised if his son who would have been 15 at the time might not have been hanging around the set.<br /><br />Also look for ████ ████ though you might have trouble spotting him under a big bushy beard.<br /><br />Watching The Big Trail now it is interesting to speculate where ████ █████'s career might have gone if The Big Trail had been a big hit.
