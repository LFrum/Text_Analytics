In this episode, █████ and Eko go searching for the "?" symbol that we saw during the lock-down on a previous episode. Michael, having shot ███ █████ and █████, struggles with his actions as █████ inches closer to death.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). Is during the commercial break. █████ and Eko find a hatch under the plane that killed █████ in season one, and a new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989" In a following commercial break, a rather bizarre and nondescript commercial advertises "The Hanso Foundation" (a planted commercial), and the website advertised (www.sublymonal.com) leads the visitor through a world of information about life on the outside of LOST's storyline. A must see for all fans!
