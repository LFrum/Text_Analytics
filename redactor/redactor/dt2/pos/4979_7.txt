████ Parrish is an ex Union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the ████████'s over at Anchor. The trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully Parrish and his workers, he has a change of heart, particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worse.<br /><br />Originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration, chiefly because of the cast that was involved. When you got ██████ ██ ████████, █████ ████ and ███████ ████████ in the same movie, you hope that they get a story and script from which to excel. Sadly they don't get chance to produce a Western classic worthy of multiple revisits, or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice?. Well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture. I think yes it's fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from, it is, when all is said and done, a plot that has been milked for all it's worth, and then some. But The Violent Men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production.<br /><br />█████ ████ as Parrish is as cool as an ██████'s nose throughout, and it's always great to see ████ ████████ playing a bitch because she's good at it. While █████ █, when one gets used to him being in a Western, is fine in what is an under written part. ████████, who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as ███ ████████, █████████ ████████ got injured, is the one who is short changed the most by the makers, even supporting characters such as the devilish ████ ███████ {a grinning delight from the reliable ███████ ███████} and ██████ ████████ {a radiant ██████ ██████} get something to leave an impression with. But for what it is, ████████'s crutch toting "bad" guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons.<br /><br />Not shy on action and gun play, it's with the twists and almost Shakespearean tragedies that ███████ ████'s film rises above the mundane, with all of it gorgeously framed by ███████ ██████'s stunning cinematography. ████ Pine in Alabama has been used on many a Western picture {see █████ ███ From Now for another glorious use of it}, but here ██████ really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn. The Violent Men isn't a great Western picture, and perhaps a better director than ████ could have really given ██████ ████████'s {The Big Country} novel an adaptation to be proud of. But for every niggle and irk i personally had with it, i found two more reasons to actually really like it, so that it be, it's recommended, for sure. 7/10
