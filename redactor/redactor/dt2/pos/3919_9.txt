I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of ███ was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.<br /><br />█████ ██████ was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...<br /><br />She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. ████, eh? Brian ███ ████ was very good as both the killers, ██ and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair). Usually he plays a mean cop or soldier, but he did very well in this.<br /><br />█████ ████████ and ████ ███████ ██████ also acted very well as █████ and ████ █████. ████ took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, then █████ stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger clipped off, ripping her lips apart after they got glued together, and getting a straight forward punch in the face by ██.<br /><br />Overall, I give this movie an 8/10. Fans of horror films MUST see this.
