Please let me know of any versions of Precious Bane or ████ to Earth on video that people may be aware of. I love the books of ████ ████ wholeheartedly and would be very grateful to have any information on either VHS or DVD.<br /><br />I've read Precious Bane and ████ to Earth, which are my favorites by ████ ████, many times, and have collected other novels by her also. I was lucky to have found her "Springs of Joy" poetry and essays, but I've never been able to see the Precious Bane version that was on ███████████ ███████, or the full version of ████ to Earth, although there was an American Movie Classic airing of The Wild Heart which was a chopped-up version of ████ to Earth's original film. <br /><br />If anyone can assist me in obtaining copies of either or both of these films (full versions), I would be so thankful!
