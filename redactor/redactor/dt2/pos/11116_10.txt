This movie has become an iconic stand-in for what is great about America. <br /><br />Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several standout actors, singers, and dancers, including █████ ████, ████ ██████, ████ ██████, and the superb ████ ███████ ███. <br /><br />The plot is not the movie. It follows an interesting format ... but, it all really ends in a kind of mush.<br /><br />Where Parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into periodic overdrive - with the extremely poignant, sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score & performances.<br /><br />The film's climax is a song-dance fest of musicians,dancers, & score by ███████████ ████. A wonderment to behold. <br /><br />* An interesting note about the magnificent and superbly talented ████ █████ ... sometimes talent must reside in the genes ... Ms. Meara is married to one █████ ███████ and is the mother of ███ ███████ ...
