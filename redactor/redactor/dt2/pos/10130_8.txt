'█████' is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged █████ ██████ ███████, nicknamed '█████', and the football coach from the T.L. █████ ████ ██████, ██████ █████.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as █████! I would never imagine to see him in a serious performance, specially because most of the movies I watch with him are comedies. ██ ██████ is great as ██████ █████, but this actor IS great, so this is not anything new.<br /><br />The mentally challenged young man called █████ ██████ ███████, always walk around the T.L. █████ ████ ██████, without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. One day, when the football's ball is throw near him, he decides to stay with the ball, for the impatience of ██████ ████, one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met. One day, ████ decides to punish █████, mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up.<br /><br />When coach █████ discovers that horrible act, he stays angry and punish all the team, deciding for this day on to help █████, who gets the nickname '█████' because of his passion for radios in general.<br /><br />The movie shows how █████ becomes an adept assistant, helping the team train despite hardships from the players, and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city. <br /><br />I would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. It has a life lesson,specially showing us how a person can make a difference, even not being what we call ''normal''. █████ has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone, and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives.
