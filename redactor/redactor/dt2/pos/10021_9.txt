A gem of a cartoon from the silent era---it was re-discovered by CARTOON NETWORK, and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades, if ever.<br /><br />What makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos...███████ █████████ is attacked by giant mosquitos; ████ ████ pays a visit as 'boss' of ██████ ███████; as well as appearances by ███████, Keaton, and ███████ ██ ████. The image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace (a money-making idea for █████'s near-bankrupt shoe-=salesman boss) cannot be described--it must be viewed. A terrific cultural gem.
