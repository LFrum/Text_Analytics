One of my favorites non-MGM musicals, it's a classic!> ████ ████████ is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. ████ █████ shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. ████ Silvers is the perfect second bananas, and ███ █████ injects this movie with a lot of class.<br /><br /> The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies, █████ ████ hasn't been adapted to theatre.
