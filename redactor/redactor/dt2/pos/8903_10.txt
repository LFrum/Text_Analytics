wow! it's even better than I expected! the best animated ███████ movie ever! and it feels so good to hear █████ █████ doing the voice of ███████ again! I surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of ███████! but I suggest that you go to see the french version, cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast! did you know that █████ █████ has played ███████ for nearly forty years? i think he did a marvelous job! and the song from ██████ ████ at the end fits rally good to the end credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are wonderful... in a word: a masterpiece! go to see it! you will not regret this!
