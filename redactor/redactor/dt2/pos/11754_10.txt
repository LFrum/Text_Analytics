Two great stars and a legendary Director created a magnificent throbbing love story that is memorable and moving on so many levels.<br /><br />█████ ████ directed ████████ █████ in her first hit Song of ██████████ and he again directs ████████ █████ in this film and ████ █████ is perfect in this role and gives a edgy, beautiful performance that captures the conflict in the character and ████ ██████ who hit home run after home run in the l950's with a series of smash hit films beginning with ██████ ████, Stalag 17, ████ Yesterday,███████ ████, Picnic, and of course █████ ████ is superb in this role.Hard to imagine anyone but ██████ in this movie I loved the ending and cry every time I see it. For anyone who has ever loved and lost, you will understand. For those who haven't, you won't.
