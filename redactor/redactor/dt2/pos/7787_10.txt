█████ Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time.Both █████ and ██████ khan have acted brilliantly while █████'s acting was far better than salman.█████ ████ is known as 'MR. PERFECTIONIST' in Bollywood and he proves it in every of his film.<br /><br />The story moves around two young guys Amar (█████ ████) and Prem (██████ ████) both are from poor families and are a big dreamer.They want to become rich without bearing any pain.so when they hear about ███████ █████ (███████ ██████) daughter of Mr.Bajaj(Paresh Rawal) who comes to India to find his bridegroom , they both fool their fathers to marry ███████ █████ and the journey begins.There is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny.Paresh Rawal is in double role (Teja and ███ █████) and has acted brilliantly as he always does.Shakti kapoor (crime master Gogo) also adds a great comedy.<br /><br />This movie is a rib tickling comedy from first minute till last and it is one of classic comedy movies of Bollywood.
