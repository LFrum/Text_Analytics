This is a novelty in Danish film. The mood is not unlike that of █████████ ██████, also by ██████ ██████ ██████, but with a novel touch. One difference is fewer characters, leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into. And what characters?! The two butchers are perfect. ████ █████████ is a dominating, deranged parody and ███████ ███ ████ an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two.
