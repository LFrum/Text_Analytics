Wow, I've sure seen quite a bit of █████ ███████ this summer. I didn't know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years. It's like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me, much like ████████ ████ did a couple of years ago.<br /><br />"███████'s Peak" is the third quality softcore flick I've seen █████ ███████ in, with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the others. "Desire and Deception" was okay, but it wasn't spectacular. There's spoilers in this review, so read only if you want to.<br /><br />The story begins with █████████ (█████ ███████) heading out of the big city and to the mountains. She has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge. Before she can even set her things down, some woman named ███ (uncredited in this film, but quite the aggressive one) begins booking guests to stay there. Now she has to get the house into shape quickly--in comes Chip (█████ ████████), a childhood friend, to the rescue. Chip helps her get the house in workable condition. She hires two local slackers to work in her lodge--Chip's sister Bait (████████ McConnell) and her sex buddy ████.<br /><br />Now the guests start coming. The first to arrive are ████ and █████ (Flower), two stereotypical money-first lawyers. █████ and ████ get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup; sad stuff there. Next, there's romance novelist ██████, played by B-movie goddess ███████ ██████. She's using that silly alias ███████ █████████ again, and she's got a very professional look this time--with blonde hair, of course. It wouldn't be ███████ if she didn't have at least one scene where she plays with herself--and she obliges, during one of ████ and █████'s sex scenes.<br /><br />█████ and █████ (██████ ████--yes, the porn star ██████ ████) show up for a little weekend getaway as well. Unbeknownst to █████, █████ and █████████ have quite a history. █████ and █████████ used to date, but █████████ broke it off to head to this mountain lodge. █████ comes up to the lodge to get █████████ back, but his plan backfires. █████████ spills the beans to █████, which causes █████ to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals. █████ ends up in the sleeping bag of the now-single ████, and they leave together. Bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with ████, and █████████ finds true love with Chip, with ██████ soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel. <br /><br />In fact....if you ask me, this whole movie played out like a romance novel. I don't know if the screenwriter was going for that effect, but I sure got that impression. ██████ had some of the best lines in this film, playing up the idea that this is a live-action romance novel. She seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going on.<br /><br />Now to the sex. There was a fair amount of it, and it was the usual bump-and grind stuff. ███████ did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes. This film was tapeworthy, and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes.<br /><br />Women: A- (███████ was simply ███████. Out of all the softcore actresses I've seen over the years, she's the best at acting, in my opinion. She can really act and be sexy, which is why she's holding on to the #1 position in my Skinemax Top 10. █████ ███████ is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera "███████s"; I don't know why she's not doing more of these. Flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role. ████████ McConnell continues to impress me, and ██████ ████ is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at it.)<br /><br />Sex: B (It was good, but not awe-inspiring spectacular. Plenty of moaning. Don't watch the R-rated version, trust me....most of the good stuff is taken out. My grade is for the uncut version.)<br /><br />Story: B (A solid storyline which throws in a contrived "Ooh, the building inspector's gonna shut us down" subplot toward the end which messes up things. The underlying story between █████████ and █████ was nice, and ██████'s dialogue, full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels, was a nice touch.)<br /><br />Overall: B+ (I found this movie to be quite entertaining. It's not a surefire ████████ Hall-Of-Famer like "Girl for Girl" is, but it's a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.)
