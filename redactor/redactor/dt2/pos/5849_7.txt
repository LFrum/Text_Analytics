This thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat. I saw it on video, some of the landscape at "the bluff" might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen. Cast has ██████ ███████, ███ ███████ (from "The Truth About Cats & ████"), ███████ ████ (█████ ██████ in "██████'s Creek") and ████ ███████ (???).
