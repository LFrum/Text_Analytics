I've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it.<br /><br />The story begins with a duel between a righteous ███████ priest and our villain █████ █████, needless to say, █████ █████ kicks Buddhist ass, and wages his campaign against ███████ unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies (a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring, a black clad one who fights with a spear, and my favourite; one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet). The rest of the story concerns the training of the disciples of the ███████ monks killed by █████ white, one of whom is █████████ ██ ███. Whilst we are treated to the punishing training sequences the two young avengers must go through to learn the ███████ Finger Jab technique needed to defeat █████ █████'s invincible armour technique, we see some of the ways our villain keeps in shape...mostly using ██████ magic to extract the blood from naked ladies. We all know how this is going to end, but it's the psychedelic trip in between that we're here for. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan was doing when Hong Kong was getting sick of martial arts movies, and that is making more and more outrageous martial arts movies. This movie is very well choreographed, has some nudity, some gore and enough balls to the wall gimickry to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained. Visit your local Beewise today!<br /><br />
