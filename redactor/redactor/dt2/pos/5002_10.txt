"Who do you dream of? ████ ██████ ... █████ █████? I'm talking about the *theater*!" [█████ ███████]<br /><br />Nothing beats a great stage show ... nothing! And █████ ███████ lives that belief. A stage actor still waiting for his big break, █████ brings the magic of live theater to a small town and to █████ █████████ (TOM HULCE) ... a young man who has big dreams (but just didn't know it until he met █████).<br /><br />With scenes and songs from many of America's classic musicals ... Those Lips, Those Eyes conveys both the ups and downs of the people that, for 2 hours, take us to a fantasy land, but who manage to keep that magic alive in their hearts all day long!<br /><br />Like █████ ... once you've seen Those Lips, Those Eyes ... "You're hooked, kid!" [█████ ███████]
