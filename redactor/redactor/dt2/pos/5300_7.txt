█████ ████████'s latest and eighth film for ██████ ███████, "████ ██ ██ ██ █████" (█████ on the █████ by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that ████████ is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories. <br /><br />The story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea sprite/goldfish and the human child that she encounters during a curious outing to see the human world. The human child, ██████ (███ ██████) lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in Southern Japan (based on ████ ██████) where he lives with his young mom, ████ (█████████ ██████). ██████ names the strange goldfish "█████" and takes it to the daycare/nursing center that ████ works at. █████ is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects (she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat) by sampling some blood from a cut on ██████'s finger. <br /><br />Yet just as ██████ and █████ begin to develop a bond, █████ is taken back by her father, ████████ (██████ ████) who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now attempting to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that aid him in repairing and rejuvenating the world's oceans.<br /><br />█████'s desire to become human has become so strong however that ████████ is unable to contain her anymore and she takes on a more human appearance and breaks free from her water world home and goes back to see ██████. <br /><br />During her breakout, █████ unintentionally releases ████████'s cache of magical elixirs which unleashes all sorts of magical sea creatures that causes a violent storm in the seas surrounding ██████'s town. Desperate to resolve █████'s rebellion, he soon calls upon the help of his beautiful wife, █████'s mother - the water elemental, Mother/Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). <br /><br />As with his past films, ████████'s "████ ██ ██ ██ █████" touches upon various themes of ecology and environmentalism, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is at times sobering when █████ encounters a drudging vessel which is scraping the ocean's floor, uncovering mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of ████████ who has spent his lifetime trying to repair the damage civilization is doing to its oceans, yet finding it an daunting and almost fruitless endeavor.<br /><br />Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film. It is at times bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious. Clearly ████████ wanted to capture the sense and style of a child's imagination. The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful. It is almost like a child's color book come to life.<br /><br />Child actors ████ █████ and ███ ██████ do great work as █████ and ██████. They bring adorable charm to their roles. ████ █████ in particular sounds so darn cute as █████ that it is little wonder that ███'s ██████ falls for the magical girl. Former campaign girl/model and actress █████████ ██████ (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good in her role as ██████'s modern mom, ████. I was a bit confused at first by her character as I initially thought she was ██████'s older sister. It also didn't help that ██████ kept referring to her as "████" rather than Mom but I guess it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the anime series ██████ ████████, ██████████ also refers to his mom by first name as well).<br /><br />80s comedian ██████ ████ sounds totally different as the serious ████████ but wisely doesn't make his character sound cartoony villainous or goofy menacing. While we don't get to know his character more, former pro-baseball player and actor █████████ █████████ ( who portrays ██████'s father ██████) also delivers some nice voice work. The opening theme "Umi No Okasan" by Japanese soprano ██████ ███████ is simply beautiful and stirring. In contrast the Fujimaki Fujioka and ██████ ██████ "████ ██ ██ ██ █████" theme is light and amusing and evokes images of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. During one brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost Wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like "███ ███████".<br /><br />The film is not perfect however and does suffer from moments where the central story of █████ and ██████ takes a back seat to some of ████████'s overwhelming fantastical visuals. I also had wished we had more time to explore ████████'s back-story as well as the relationship between ██████ and his father.<br /><br />Like "████'s Delivery Service/Majo No Takkyubin", "████'s Moving Castle", "Princess Momonoke/Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro/Tonari No Totoro", "████ ██ ██ ██ █████" is another ████████ classic that is a marvelous feast for the eyes. Like a modern day fairytale, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in years to come.
