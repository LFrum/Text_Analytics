There have been many movies about people returning home from wars and having to cope, but "The War at Home" is worth seeing. Portraying ███████ vet ██████ ███████ (██████ ███████) having trouble connecting with his Texas family, much of the movie is very likely to tense you up. But nothing can prepare you for what ends up getting revealed.<br /><br />Part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feeling of both Texas and of the generation gap. Jeremy's parents ███ (██████ █████) and Maurine (█████ █████) clearly have a problem with their son's attitude, both about the war and his rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (████████ ████████) is uncertain with whom to side. But after the dinner, there can be no neutrality.<br /><br />So, we as Americans may never be able to fully get over the ███████ War, but this movie can probably help us look seriously at how it affected so many people. ██████ ███████ certainly did a good job directing. Also starring █████ █████ and █████ ██████.
