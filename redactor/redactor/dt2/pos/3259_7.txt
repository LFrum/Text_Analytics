I had never heard of this movie, but I like █████ ██████ and █████ █████ and the story sounded interesting, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I found it to be very enjoyable. █████ ██████ plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough, so he goes and asks for work from mobster █████ █████. I won't go into details but things go very bad for ██████ and gets into big trouble with █████ █████. From their on the movie just gets better and better, with one scene involving ██████ hooking up with a pair of bank robbers. And lets not forget the beautiful ████ █████, who plays ██████'s love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.
