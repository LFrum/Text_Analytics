This is another of my favorite ███████s. It sports a top-notch cast, including ████ ██████████, who was never handsomer or sexier, █████████ █████, █████ ███, and ██████ ██████. Now here's something I've always wondered - had ███████ ███████ been born when this episode was shot, or was ██████ pregnant at the time? Thanks to IMDb, I have my answer - she was five months' pregnant. Now I can really feel ancient.<br /><br />Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to ██████ was apparently to use the social connections of her mother (Loy). He has a mistress on the side, █████████ █████, a prominent pianist, but she announces she wants more. She's sick of being back street. On the night of their concert, he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. ███████ picks up a few problems immediately. One thing he notices: "You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body, and a career. Where's the man?" It's wonderful to see ████ and good friend Cassavetes together. There's a very funny episode at the vet with ███████'s ███████. Everyone in the cast is great.<br /><br />This is one of the episodes that made ███████ the classic series it became.
