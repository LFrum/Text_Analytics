After I saw "La Pianiste" several years ago, I said to myself that I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing it was. ████ went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, █████ █████ out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book "The Piano Teacher" by ████████ ███████, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as "██ ████████". Three actors gave outstanding performances. █████ ████████'s Piano music, "soaked in the morbid humanity", is another bright star of the movie.<br /><br />I only have one problem with ██████'s vision. There is a scene in the film where ██████ made some changes to █████'s character comparing to the novel. In the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to ██████, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her, was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. █████ of the book would never chase ██████ to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make █████ sympathetic (and of course, ███████ was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - ███████ did not write that scene, it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.
