"The King of Queens" could be divided into two eras.<br /><br />The first era, constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck.<br /><br />The second era, increased the scope of the show, addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin.<br /><br />But besides all of that...<br /><br />This show was freaking hilarious.<br /><br />█████ █████, when not doing crap comedy films with ████ ███████, is a genius of laughter, and his chemistry with ████ ██████ was unparalleled on TV.<br /><br />█████ ███████ as the psychotic live-in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor, and ██████ ██████ as the "man-child" Spence ██████ was amazing, (he's a great comedian too) "The King of Queens" was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air, and it's a damn shame. Now, all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance. I like many fans of actually funny TV shows am now in a state of mourning
