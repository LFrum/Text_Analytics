After three outstanding BBC television series' and a Christmas special, the bizarre and grotesque (yet perversely lovable) characters of bleak fictional town ███████ █████ make the jump to celluloid, along with their creators - The League of Gentlemen. <br /><br />████ ██████, █████ █████████ and █████ ██████████ are the more familiar three-quarters of the foursome, with the central roles shared between the trio. In an added twist, the final member of the team - ██████ █████ - is portrayed by actor ███████ █████. <br /><br />Where to start? █████ (█████) is in conversation with his writing cohorts, when - horror of horrors - he is paid a visit by two of his grisliest characters. Both Tubbs (█████████) and ██████ █████████ (Shearsmith) are unhappy at The League's decision to kill off the █████ inhabitants. "You're not real!" screams █████ in vain, as the local shopkeepers from hell exact their revenge. Mayhem ensues, as reality and █████ converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs. <br /><br />Confused? You will be, as the camp, innuendo-ridden Teutonic, ████ ████ (█████████) is forced to take on the daily guise of █████████ (█████████), while █████████ (█████████) is kidnapped by cannibalistic butcher ███████ █████ (Gatiss) and █████ █████ (Shearsmith). <br /><br />With shades of an even more demented Misery, Briss attempts to force █████████ to rewrite the film - thus continuing his life - but leaving █████ in charge is never a good idea. The erstwhile comedian becomes embroiled in The League's latest, post-█████ adventure - The King's Evil - entering a typically twisted 17th century England, complete with cameos from Victoria Wood, █████ ███ and █████ ██████. Known as ██████ of Asda (due to his select line of clothing), █████ saves the day and is treated as a hero, but for the denouement of the film, he joins characters old and new at the Church of ███████ █████ to meet with their makers. <br /><br />For fans of the series, the film is a must-see. And yes, it does feature ████ ███████ (albeit a little too fleetingly). Pen-loving ███████, Mickey, ███████ and cursed vet ███████ ████████ are some of the other favourites on show, and The League's portrayal of themselves (plus █████'s as █████) is also a fascinating insight. <br /><br />The League of Gentlemen are the Radiohead of British comedy - they are ambitious, groundbreaking (witness the excellent ██████ █████) and not happy to rest on their laurels. They also divide opinion accordingly.<br /><br />Certainly, their macabre sense of humour is not for every palate, and while not written exclusively for 'fans', a grasp of the storyline would benefit those who have previously viewed the series. Nevertheless, ██████████ is a film in its own right and The League will no doubt manage to attract a new breed of fan, as well as appeasing and pleasing existing ones.
