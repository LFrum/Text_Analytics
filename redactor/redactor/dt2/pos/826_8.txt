Like ██████ ██████ I also am a big ███ █████ fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career.<br /><br />In this flick ███ █████ assumes the role of ████ █████████ whom is a cop that just moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of the Border Patrol. Haunted by memories of his past, it is up to ████ to put an end to a group of Ex-Navy Seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S. that killed his daughter.<br /><br />Overall I found this film to be very good, ███ █████ is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move. The action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing. Unfortunately ███ █████ does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago, regardless The Shepherd: ██████ ███████ is the 3rd straight solid film that ███ █████ has made possibly opening the door for a larger project.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this movie to a ███ █████ fan or fan of action movies in general; The Shepherd: ██████ ███████ is a great movie, not as good as Until Death but better than the Hard Corps. Be sure to give this one a try, you will not be disappointed.
