"Best in Show" is a often hilarious mockumentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who prepare for the event. The only thing that separates this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in "Best in Show" act more sane than their owners! Funny stuff from a top-notch cast that includes ██████ ████ (who co-wrote the film), █████████ ██████, ██████ █████, ███████ ██████, ████████ ████████, ████ █████, and ███████████ █████ (who co-wrote with ████ and directed). They're all funny, but ████ ███████ steals the movie with his explosively funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things. Plus the dogs are cute too. "Best in Show" isn't exactly the laugh riot that I expected, but there are laughs and it's worth seeing.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
