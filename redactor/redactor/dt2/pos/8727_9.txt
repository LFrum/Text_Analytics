██████ ████'s depiction of a simple young lady caught up in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, played with such relish by ██████ ███████, that she won the best supporting actress █████ for 1969.<br /><br />The film, however, is another tribute to ██████ ███████. Rarely, did we ever see her in a comedy and she literally kicks up her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is thrust into a scheme for ███████ to tell ████ that they're married.<br /><br />It is such a joy to watch ███████ and ███████ fall for each other here. Theirs is an accidental love affair in the making.<br /><br />As ███████'s friend, ████ ██████ is fabulous as his partner in the scheme as well. ████ Lenz gives ample support as ████'s newly-found boyfriend as well.
