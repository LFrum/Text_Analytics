There are a lot of people that put down on these type 80's movies but those people may not have been coming of age during this time. I was just starting college when this movie was released so I could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and I still, to this day, will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie. As much as I liked ████ ████'s Character ████ ███████ in "████ █████", I actually enjoy █████ ████'s Character "█████" more because he is the lead character with more of a actual speaking roll opposed to just a series of one liners such as with ███████. █████ ████ should probably pop this film in his VCR and use it for motivation to lose some weight. Yes, the subplot with the Randy Quaid, ███████ vet character does seem a little out of place, but he does a convincing job in the role. If there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie but liked the other similar type movies such as "████ █████", etc. I highly recommend it.
