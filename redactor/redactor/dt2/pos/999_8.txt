From the start of "The Edge Of Love", the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named █████ ██████, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. <br /><br />This movie is based on ██████' writings about love and romance. These were adapted with a sharp screenplay by ███████ █████████ (█████ █████████'s mother). The director, ████ ███████, does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people. <br /><br />All four are performed very strongly. ██████ ██████ is █████'s wife, █████ █████████ is the cabaret singer ████ ████████. ███████ ████ is █████ ██████, and ███████ ██████ is ███████ ███████. The first section of the movie takes place in London during the Nazi air raids, with ████ being pursued by ███████, a soldier waiting for deployment. By a chance encounter, █████ meets with his first love, ████. From there ████ meets ███████, █████'s wife. While the three are drinking, ███████ successfully breaks ████'s guard. <br /><br />The film follows their lives as ████ and ███████ are married and he is sent to war. ████ has become pregnant, and returns to █████ with █████ and ███████. There they face a gritty existence, with ████ supporting █████ and ███████ with her husband's war pay. Through these times, ████'s and ███████'s friendship grows. So does █████'s infatuation with ████. She gives in. This creates the first test for the two women. <br /><br />When ███████ returns from war, he barely recognizes his wife, and has no bond with his infant son. Things get worse, as █████ idly watches his friend struggle with battleground fatigue (post traumatic stress disorder). ███████ realizes something has happened between █████ and ████, and in a drunken rage shoots up █████'s house.<br /><br />"Edge Of Love" starts as a stylish romance in war torn London and ends in the stark, gritty life of motherhood, infidelity, and attempted murder in █████. The treatment of PTSD is well done, and should speak to an American audience. Some day (see ending).<br /><br />Each star has a great moment. ██████ when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child. █████████ and █████ when he finally bonds with his son. Oh hell, almost all their scenes are awesome. And ████ when he purgers himself on the stand to get ████'s husband sent to jail. <br /><br />Yet, the real star of the movie is ████████ ███████'s cinematography and ████ ███████'s direction. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical ██████ is, this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they cherish their scenes with stunning shots. While this isn't best picture material, it is a very good movie (much more engaging than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of ██████' poetry. Also, this is clearly █████████'s second best performance of her career, and perhaps ██████'s best. <br /><br />I have always had a weakness for the Artist in struggle, whether it's █████'s ██████, or ███████'s Capote. But I was stunned at how little sympathy I felt for █████ ██████. His struggles with alcohol are well known. But his antagonism of ███████ and ███████ to gain possession of his first love ████ makes him out to be.....a bad man.<br /><br />So is this Academy █████ ██████? Clearly no. At least, not this year. It will be released state side in March, 2009, making it ineligible for the Academies. This is 9 months after it was released in Britain. ███████ █████████, ████ █████████, and Brideshead Revisited, the US has had its fill of WW2 British period pieces. Too bad. This film is better then the other ones, except Atonement. But in this one, █████████'s soldier does come back, but as a shell of the man who left her.
