██████ is unquestionably a comedian's comedian and a comedian to anyone looking for a good time. His first film, which is entirely his own creation and production, tells the story of a struggling Chicago actor █████ █████ with whom ████ obviously identifies. He wonderfully juxtaposes █████ to █████ █████████'s "█████" and to ██████ ███████'s ████ ████ as he exposes █████' dilemmas with an array of actors that in real life are ████'s friends, many who are fellow Second City alumni.<br /><br />He delightfully uses █████ █████████'s diametrical cuteness and scathingly absurd humor to exemplify how despite common sense and talent, life's contentment can too often belie unyielding frustration. ██████ Hunt gives an endearing performance as a romantic interest.<br /><br />Don't let a simple story mislead you, the characters and conflicts are well thought out and ring true. Those that follow ██████'s career and understand that his humor is based on telling reality humorously, not necessarily creating fiction which too easily can be contrived, will appreciate his dialogue driven story.<br /><br />We surely will see ██████ working much more as director and writer with other talented intelligent comedic actors who undertake the great challenge of making life funny.
