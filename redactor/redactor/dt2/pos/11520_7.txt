Take away all parts of the movie that were "present" day and stick to the flashbacks. Then you would have had a great story. Faith and ████'s story and their relationship was the best part. ████ and █████████ were wonderful. ████████ was ponderous to sit through. Surprised to see ██████ ██████ as mom. She was great. Also look for ███████ ██████ as the father, always like him (Sleeping with the Enemy). This is a very hippy, save the world, kind of film. Don't care for it much, but I recommend seeing it for ████'s performance alone. She has excellent range and it should be used more. █████████ is, as always, compelling. He's wonderful!
