The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character ██████ "█████" Crosby, who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy, █████, the narrator of the film. Based upon the experiences of writer-actor █████ ███████████████, the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. <br /><br />The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse. █████'s ability "to take fragments and make them whole" affects everyone within her sphere. An especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband, telling him firmly, "If you ever touch that child again, we're going to dance!" As delivered by actress S. ██████ █████████, that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks. <br /><br />From start to finish, █████████ delivers a commanding presence Her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home. This was a touching, heartfelt film with a wonderful cast. As played by █████████, the character of █████ simply radiates love. This is a film experience that I will remember for a long time to come.
