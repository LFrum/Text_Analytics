On a second viewing, this is still a wonderful romance that is, in my opinion, much better than the film it came paired with on my 2-DVD set, the Leo McCarey weepie classic "An Affair To Remember". Yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly (Only a 6.6 rating here on IMDb, and dismissed by many critics as "gooey slush"). How sad, because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by the two leads, ████████ █████ and ███████ ██████. If anything the film should be well-remembered for the gorgeous colour cinematography and the unforgettable musical score. I don't much like █████████'s Day but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again, and I'm glad of it. While I still think ██████'s character death is too heavily foreshadowed, taking suspense out of the final scenes, this film is very moving and I really enjoy it.
