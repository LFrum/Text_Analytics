After another raid in an empty village, the chief of the Vikings Timandahaf misunderstands the explanation of his adviser Cryptograf that "fear gives wings to the dwellers" and believes that fear actually makes the villagers fly. They decide to chase the champion of fear in Gaul to learn how to fly and make them invincible warriors. Meanwhile, the nephew of Vitalstatistix, Justforkix, is sent from Parisium to the Gaulish village to become a man and ███████ and ██████ are assigned to train the youngster. The stupid son of Cryptograf, ████, listens to a conversation of the coward Justforkix with ███████ and ██████ and kidnaps him. While returning to the Viking village, Justforkix meets ████, the daughter of Timandahaf, and they fall in love for each other. But the Machiavellian and ambitious Cryptograf plan to marry his son ████ with ████ and become powerful. In the end, ███████ realizes that it is not fear that gives wings, it is love.<br /><br />When I was a teenager, ███████ was my favorite comic book and I read all the Goscinny and Uderzo stories. This feature film shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. The romance of Justforkix and the gorgeous ████ is delightful and the situations ███████ and ██████ get involved are hilarious. My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "███████ e os Vikings" ("███████ and the Vikings")
