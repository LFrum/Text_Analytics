Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release but some libraries have the VHS and well worth seeking out. Just a brilliant play about many things, foremost being euthanasia, "respectability", religion, and fundamental human relationships. The script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with an issue like a severely disabled child, but to bind the parents in their love for "Jo" and each other. As the couple, ████ █████ and █████ ██████ are perfectly matched both in acting virtuosity and in bringing their deep, intelligent characters to life.<br /><br />I've recently seen █████' brilliant performance in "██████" which was released as a film a couple years after "███ ███" and he plays a teacher in both, cynical, intellectual, and funny, although ██████ is much darker than his character of ███ here. If you throw in such great performances in "The Go-Between", "Women in Love", "███████ ████ the Wind", "The Caretaker" and "██████ ████," not to mention the more obvious "King of Hearts" and "Zorba the Greek", and I'd say that ████ █████ had a career comparable to █████ ███████, ██████ ██████, and the other great British actors of his era.<br /><br />Director █████ █████ also had one of my all-time favorites "The Ruling Class" released the same year (1972) as "███ ███", which comprises a career year in anybody's book. He's had kind of a spotty filmography("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two gems will mark him as a great director.
