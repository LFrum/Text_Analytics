I recently visited the Magic Kingdom as an adult with my mom, her best friend and my adult sister. ██████ █████ is often mistakenly perceived as a place for just children, but when you see quality shows like ██████'s Philharmagic, you realize that the magic of ██████ is for everyone! It was such a great show that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again. And then a third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I would encourage anyone who goes to ██████ █████ to check out this show, which is not just a show but a world wind, fun filled ride with ██████ as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble!
