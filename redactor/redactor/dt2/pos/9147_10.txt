No matter how many times ████ █████████ "█████████ █████████" ██████ tries to get ████ "███████ ████████" ██████, we always know what's going to happen, though our sympathy always remains with WEC. The highlight in "Hook, ████ and Stinker" is a Rube Goldberg-style scheme that WEC hopes will finally finish off RR; but of course you know what happens.<br /><br />So, ████ █ █ continues hilarious engaging in fanaticism (defined by ██████ █████████ as redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim) while ████ ██████ pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - in which he could find himself. A real classic.<br /><br />And yes, the coyote's middle name is █████████. I learned that from "Jeopardy!".
