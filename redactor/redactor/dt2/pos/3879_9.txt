He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific ██████ ███ ███████ wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great ██████ ███████ who played main character Col. ████ "Hannibal" █████, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including ████ ████████ (Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, ██████ ███████ (Capt. H.M. "Howling Mad" Murdock), ███████ █████ (Amy Amanda Allen), ███████ ███████ (Col. Lynch) and █████ ███████ (Col. ████████ ██████, the only member of the team to die). He did talk to ███ █ (Sgt. Bosco "B.A." Baracus) in an anticipated interview, but he was unavailable to turn up at the reunion. It was really fun watching him trying to find them, and talking to them, even though they probably didn't want to, and the reunion of course is the great climax. Very good!
