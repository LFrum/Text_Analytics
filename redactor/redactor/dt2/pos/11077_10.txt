I am NOT one to like those Anime Cartoons (eg.Pokemon,Dragonball Z,Naruto), But █████ ████ is Different in my opinion.█████ ████ is more Exciting, has better characters, and doesn't focus so much on a sort of weapon or ██████ as much as the episodes i've seen,Such as it The Episodes "Big ███████ ████████", "Zatch vs. Kiyo".█████ ████ Really focuses on the Life of The Strange Zatch,The Smart Kiyo,The Clueless Suzy,and the WeIrD Ponygon.█████ ████ is probably my Fav Cartoon for now,but I encourage others to watch 1 Episode of it, you'll most likely will like it!<br /><br />-Robbie H.
