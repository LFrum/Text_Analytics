"█████ ████: Men in Tights" has received no respect whatsoever. It was hilarious! ████ █████ was excellent as the "Prince of Thieves," and █████ █████████, ███ ███████, ███████ ███████, ███████ █████ and ████ ██████████ as ███████ all did fine jobs. I will never understand the hostility toward "█████ ████: Men in Tights," but I do know a great comedy when I see one.<br /><br />"█████ ████: Men in Tights" receives *** out of ****.
