** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /><br />Recap: Macleane (██████) witnesses a robbery by ████████ (███████) that goes wrong. ████████'s partner get shot (and killed) but not until after he has swallowed a great ruby. ████████ and Macleane then meet at the cemetery when both try to get hold of the ruby. Unfortunately they are caught as grave robbers and sent to jail, but not until ████████ has swallowed the ruby. The ruby is their key to freedom, and once they're free, they form a partnership in robbery. Macleane is to pose as a gentleman and find out who is worth robbing, and then simply they rob him (and rob them in style). But Macleane falls in love with the niece/daughter (?) of their first victim, lady ███████ ██████ (█████). And a Mr Chance (Stott) is out to catch them, and his methods are not very nice...<br /><br />Comments: A good action flavoured by comedy and adventure. ███████ and ██████ form a good team, with a lot of friction and friendship. And then there is the relationship between Macleane and ███████ ██████. The scene with the ball is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of the music. In addition to these interesting characters Cumming play the best of them all, ████ █████████. Both the character and the acting are stellar and among the best in the movie. In total, the movie works very well, a nice balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. Very entertaining.<br /><br />8/10
