A grumpy old baronet, happily unmarried, decides to send for his three grown-up illegitimate children and provide them a home at his manor. To his surprise, he finds himself bonding with his uninhibited American daughter. Can he find satisfaction in his new role as THE BACHELOR FATHER?<br /><br />This 1931 film, in which he gives a robust performance, marked the arrival at MGM of elderly ███ ██ ██████ █████, very soon to be one of Hollywood's most valuable character actors. With his great hooked nose & beetling brows, ███ ██████ looked every inch the part of the duke or general or statesman he would play so often. The acknowledged leader of the British community in Hollywood, ███ ██████ would also champion the game of criquet in Southern California. He would remain very much in demand in studios all over town, right up to his death in 1948.<br /><br />The film's top-billed star is ██████ ██████. Best remembered today as the mistress of media mogul ███████ ████████ ██████ & the chatelaine of ██████ ██████, the most fabulous residence on the West Coast, she was actually a very talented & pretty comedienne. For a few years, ██████ attempted to make her the queen of MGM (with her own production company & a huge bungalow-dressing room) but the studio already had several other queens - Dressler, █████, ███████, Crawford - and he eventually moved her to ██████ ████. Here ████ ██████ gets a chance to joke & clown and her scenes with ███ ██████ are entertaining.<br /><br />Her love interest is played by █████ ██████, a handsome young British actor who was just starting to find good films (THE TRAIL OF 98) as the silent days ended. He had all the qualities for major stardom, but sadly it was not to be. Celebrity would come to ███ ███████, here making one of his first screen appearances. █████████ Hobbes & █████ █████ also appear to advantage.
