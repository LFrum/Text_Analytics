When the Bicentennial hit, I was in Hershey, PA and part of the Middletown Skate Team. We didn't do anything except skate around trying to learn what we were reading in the pages of Skateboarder Magazine. A couple of local hills provided all the speed-wobbles you could handle. At the time ████ ████ was the hot stuff, along with ████ Whats-his-name, with the Z-boys hot on their tail. I had a GT (GrenTech) plastic board with █████ ███ urethane wheels (loose bearings).<br /><br />My parents told me we were moving to California later that year and that they were taking a trip to go house-hunting. I was an extremely good son that summer and asked if I might not be rewarded with a REAL skateboard from California. They delivered. It was a fiberglass deck with the Surfer Magazine logo screened on it. Wide trucks and big red wheels (precision bearings, don't ya know). They got it at Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach.<br /><br />When I got to California (all of 13), ███████ had the Concrete Wave and ████████ had a great park as well. Soon came ██████████ ███████ in Mission Viejo. An indoor park with every scenario imaginable. All the while I was reading about █████, Shogu, ████ and ███. This flick was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch.
