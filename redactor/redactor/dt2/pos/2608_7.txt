This is a cute film starring ██████, ███████ and █████████ from the "Our Gang" comedies. Set in the South during the Civil War, it may seem a little odd to see █████████ as ██████'s slave, but this film is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast. This was the only Our Gang feature film, and I highly recommend it over The Little Rascals remake from 1994.
