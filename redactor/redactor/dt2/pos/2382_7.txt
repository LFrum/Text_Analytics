good job.that's how i would describe this animated ██████-Doo adventure.this is so far the best of the animated ██████ movies i have seen.i liked the story.i thought it had some depth to to it.the movie is also well paced.it doesn't get boring for a minute.it also has an interesting group of characters(besides ██████ and ██████ and the gang,of course)plus,the movie was a real blast.i has a lot of fun watching it.i also liked the great Scottish music.it was very catchy and infectious.naturally,we know that ██████ and the Gamg will solve the mystery,but it's still fun getting to that point.the animation is also pretty good for this movie.i would love it if they did a 3D animation ██████ adventure,but we'll just have to wait and see.for me,██████-Doo and the Loch Ness monster is a 7/10
