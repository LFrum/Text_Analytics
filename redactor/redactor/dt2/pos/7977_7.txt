I really enjoyed watching ████ to Pay. I've been a fan of Westerns for as long as I can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the Westerns from the 1960s (even though I was too young to have seen them in their first run). The one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. It was distracting at times. One thing I did notice, and I wonder how many other fans of ████████ noticed, was the name of ████ ██████'s character. It was a play on ███ █████' name from ████████. Instead of ██████ █████, ████ ██████ used ████ █████. I wonder if that was his choice or █████ ████████'s? Anyway, I would recommend this movie to fans of Westerns. Don't expect anything too "deep". Just plain old entertainment.
