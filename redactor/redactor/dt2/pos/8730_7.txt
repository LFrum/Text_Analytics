Far more sprightly, and less stage and set bound than ████ ████' previous efforts ████████ in the Park(67) and The Odd Couple (68), ██████ ██████ is not a work of art, but compared to most of the tired farces from the 60's like The Apartment, ███ to Murder Your Wife, ███████ ███████, A Guide for the Marrried Man, ███████, American Style, ███ Wednesday, ████ ██ ██████, ████ █████ ███, it's a masterpiece. Director Saks and writer I.A.L. Diamond have effectively "opened up" ███ ███████' ████████ hit, and the film benefits greatly from New York City location shooting and excellent performances from ██████ ███████ and Goldie ████. ███████ is charming, looks great, and demonstrates a flair for comedy. ████ in her Oscar winning role has never been better or more appealing. Matthau is OK though it's hard to believe that ████'s character would be so enamored of him. And in retrospect, ████'s attempted suicide at the start of the film is out of character and unbelievable. Nonetheless, the film has a plausible farcical set up, and once it gets going it generates laugh. ████ Lenz, ████ ██████, ███ █████, and ████ ██████ provide good support. The film is likable and fun, and ████ and ███████ make you care.
