Dramatic license - some hate it, though it is necessary in retelling any life story. In the case of "████", the main points of ███████ ████'s teenage years, early career and 20 year marriage to ████ █████ are all included, albeit in a truncated and reworked way.<br /><br />The main emotional points of ████'s life are made clear: ███████'s struggle to find her niche as an actress, finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character ████ ███████ a legend; her turbulent, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to ████ █████; ████ & ████ creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as TV's most memorable sitcom couple.<br /><br />As ███████ ████, ██████ ████ does a commendable job. Do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one Judy █████ made when playing ████ ███████, but ████ makes Ball strong-willed yet likable, and is very funny in her own right. Even though her comedic-timing is different than ████'s, she is still believable. The film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set, and her mistreatment of ██████ █████ during the early "I Love ████" years, but watching ████ portray ████ rehearsing privately is a nice inclusion.<br /><br />██████ ████ is thinner and less charismatic than the real ████ was, but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with ████'s accent, especially in the opening scene. ████████ ████ was decent, if not overly memorable, as the teen-aged ████.<br /><br />██████ █████ and ███████ ███████ were not featured much, thankfully, since ███████ █████ and Russell Newman were not very convincing in the roles. Not that they aren't good actors in their own right, they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing. Most of the actors were from Austrailia and New Zeland, and the repressed accents are detectable at times.<br /><br />Although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. ████ Oppenheimer, the head writer of ████'s radio show "My Favourite Husband" which began in 1948, is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with "I Love ████" in 1951, completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator! This movie also depicts ████ ███████ as being the main "I Love ████" director for its entire run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by ███████ █████ after the first season! Also, though I figure this was due to budgetary constraints, the ███████'s are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in New ████, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and off-scale from the original as well. The Connecticut home looks pretty close to the original, except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured. <br /><br />There's also ████ talking about buying RKO in 1953, during ████'s red-scare incident, even though RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes well could have been for dramatic license, and the film does work at conveying the main facts, but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to Oppenheimer and █████, two vital figures in "I Love ████" history? The biggest gaff comes in the "I Love ████" recreation scenes, at least a few of them. It's always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more so when OBVIOUS CHANGES are made. The scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated, and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away! The "We're Having A Baby" number was shortened as well, but other than that it was practically dead on. By far the best was the "grape-stomping" scene, with ██████ ████ really nailing ████'s mannerisms. The producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the "Vitametavegamin" and candy factory bits, instead showing the actors rehearse them. These scenes proved effective because of that approach.<br /><br />The film's main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about ████'s life, since much is skimmed over or omitted at all. Overall, though, it gives a decent portrait of ████ & ████'s marriage, and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively.
