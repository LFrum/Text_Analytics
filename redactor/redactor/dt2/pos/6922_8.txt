Look as being Anglo-Irish I assure you this reviewer is anything but ████. But I assure you this is very much an Irish Film - and not English as the last comment seems to have suggested. This film was written by ████ ██████ and █████ █████████ and directed by █████ █████████ too - both Irish. The Cast is almost entirely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Even ███████ ██████ was born in Ireland - I remember him joking about it in an interview about this film.<br /><br />███████ ████ was evidently brought in to boost ███ office takings abroad.<br /><br />Loved the film, I just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment!<br /><br />Now on with the review - I loved █████ █████, have always been a fan of his, himself and ███████ ████ formed a surprisingly good double act. It was great to see Morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film. I would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy - as it represents a fresh, quirky and inventive turn in Irish feature length chuckle films. I laughed a lot. what more could you ask for?
