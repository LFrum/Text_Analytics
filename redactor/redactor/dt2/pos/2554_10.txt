████ ████ is a hidden treasure out in theaters! I cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. This film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like.<br /><br />This film is about a young boy, █████████ "███" who works and lives with his teenage sister, ██████ "█████" in a one-room tiny loft in an auto shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (that I did not even know existed--Willits Points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops. Here, ███████ tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to support themselves by buying and fixing up a food van.<br /><br />███ makes money helping at the auto shop, and █████ helps at a food van; both, however, earn extra money on the side. ███ sells bootleg movies and stolen car parts; █████ results to selling herself. Their lives are surrounded by grit and grim, but even though both witness, live and barely survive within their harsh world, their love for each other is never tainted by the filth that surround them. And occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that is being stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay together.<br /><br />The best comparison I have for ████ ████ is that ███████'s juxtaposition of an innocent love between family members against such a bleak atmosphere is as powerful as ████████'s Mama Roma combined with the struggles of growing up too fast in an adverse environment just as in Bresson's Mouchette.<br /><br />Having co-written, directed and edited both this film and his first, ███ ████ ████ (which won awards all over the world), ███████ is a total package filmmaker.<br /><br />I can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long!
