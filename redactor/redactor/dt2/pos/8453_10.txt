TV newscaster ████████ █████ (████ █████) and her radical camerman ███████ █████ (███████ ███████) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens. The plants managers play it down but █████ has filmed it all. █████ and █████ try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it. Plant executive ████ ██████ (████ ██████) realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. He tries to get executives to believe him--only they know it. █████, █████ and Godell find all their lives are in danger.<br /><br />I saw this in a movie theatre in 1979. I was only 17 and it scared me silly. To make matters worse the Three ████ ██████ accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real. Seeing it over 20 years later it doesn't scare me but it still is an excellent film--it works as a mystery, a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry. Fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as █████--she perfectly conveys her character's growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen. ██████ is (as always) excellent. He starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out. He was rightfully nominated for an ███████ █████ for this. Douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by ██████ and Fonda.<br /><br />A really great film--one of the best of the 70s. Don't miss this one!
