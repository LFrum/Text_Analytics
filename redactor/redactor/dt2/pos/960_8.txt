I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; It's not like American Pie or something. I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since it's part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.<br /><br />This is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy), GREAT acting, and a cheesy ending.<br /><br />(minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the ████ (████████) comes along. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (█████) and they go and drive the ████ crazy.<br /><br />███████ █████ can be annoying in other roles, but not as █████ ████████. He handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well, and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantness.<br /><br />██████ █████. What more can I say? The girl's got the gift. She's funny, talented, versatile, and very, very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than her. I need to get to California sometime soon.) In fact, the 'best-friend' part was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the makers saw ██████'s interest. Which works out pretty well, since the part would've been pretty dull without the blessing of █████'s abilities.<br /><br />████ ████████ is a very talented man. While some would play █████ ████ as evil and diabolical, ████████ made him-not just a jerk, mind you, but a LIKEABLE jerk, a jerk that livens up the screen, rather than intentionally dimming it. And I doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that ████ undergoes as well.<br /><br />All in all, great movie. Loved seeing ██████ █████ able to mock himself. Loved seeing all the little references & such built into the film. (one of the guests in the party scene is the director, █████ ████, another is █████'s former co-star █████ ████████) Loved seeing ██████ in those outfits........ Get the DVD if you can. It's got all kinds of great extra stuff, and the lovely Ms. █████ is your guide through the menus. :)
