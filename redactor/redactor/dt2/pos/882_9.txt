█████ █████ is a rare breed of film - completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation. A young man █████, superbly played by a newly face lifted ███ █████ at age 40+, is estranged from his police officer ███ and finds a job in a jeweler's store. Soon random people come up to him and call him ████. Using just a few pithy moments the presence of a "doppelganger" is established. Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (█████ █████) who is so convinced that █████ is actually ████ he makes him take his shoe off and prove that he is not ████, the 6 toed one. The jeweler's super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is completely enamored with █████. Amidst all this confusion there is a █████ thief on the loose and he is stealing at will. Slowly we learn from █████'s encounter with a super hot night club singer (█████!) that the thief is ████ the doppelganger. Many many good looking women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are after the hero. The police force, including █████'s ███, are completely befuddled. █████ is slowly falling for Shalini/Shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to ██████ as that is where ████'s next heist is to occur. The rest is for you to watch - the duplicate, the girls, the men who hang on to █████'s every word thinking he is their boss ████, the loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right, and it takes the deft story telling (and direction) by █████ █████ to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner. The movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in ██████.<br /><br />I was not a big Vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent here, although at her chubbiest. She is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way, but is best when she is sorrowful or dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this film. I so badly wanted her to get the man. ███ was, well, ███. If he were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other) I would wonder who they had found to imitate him! Yet his style, charm and charisma were unfailing. In the song ███ ███ ██ ████ ███████, only ███ could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! █████ █████ was simply awesome - ████ ████ did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books.<br /><br />SD ██████ spun magic with numbers like ██████ ████ ███ ████ ████ (█████ in a blood red rooster imitation dancing on a bar top), ██████ ██ ██████, ████ ██ ████ █████ ████, and my personal favorite seductive number ████ █████ ███ ████ ████ Diye.<br /><br />If you are craving a great story, with more twists than a pretzel, wanting to be kept guessing, yet amused and entertained - then go buy or rent █████ █████. Better to buy it, then you can go back and see it again with your buddies. This one is a keeper.
