This is a Hollywood film. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This film will not change the world. However, it is well-made, well-plotted, and well-acted, which counts for a lot.<br /><br />It's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former-CIA assassin who feels betrayed chasing a Secret Service agent who was protecting ████ ██ ███████ when ███████ was killed in Dallas. The agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992-or certainly in contemporary America, this would-be assassin █████ █████ (████ █████████ in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the President. He imagines he has common cause with Secret Service Agent █████ ████████ (█████ ████████ at his cool, calm, good-naturedly grouchy best) who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the Warren Commission, blamed ████████-unfairly, Leary believes-for the assassination of President ███████. The tension is ratcheted up through some phone calls from Leary to ████████-Leary wanting to keep ████████ close but not to betray his location and plans.<br /><br />████ █████ is excellent as Lily Raines a fellow agent with whom ████████ develops a grown- up relationship. It is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is a fair deal younger than ████████ at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the quick-witted ████████ in friendly banter. It is a nice part for Russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man. The acting by the leads, ████████ ████████'s competent direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this a film I can watch over and over.
