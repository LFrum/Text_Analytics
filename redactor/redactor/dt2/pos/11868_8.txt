One night, barkeeper █████ (████ ██████) rescues █████ (███ █████) from her jealous boyfriend ████ (██████ ████ ████). He takes █████ to his home. But ████ comes back and wants █████ to open the safe at Mc Cool´s. Suddenly a shot - ████´s dead. Then... ...I´ll better stop here to tell the plot. That´s like to explain the story of "Wild things". What I found so interesting, was the fact that the plot (written by ████ ██████, his first and his last work - he died in July last year...) was told from 3 perspectives - the 3 men that fall for █████. Everybody of them sees her from different eyes - like ████ ███████ as the detective, who tenderly falls in love with her because of being remembered of his dead wife...<br /><br />No wonder that the guys fall for her! ███ █████ - she´s a real jewel. She made the big screen shining! She played her role as if she was in a 40´s noir- thriller. Sweet - but in the same time she was the cool vamp who walks over dead body´s and uses the men for her needs. And, of course, ███████ ███████. How could I forget him? ██ █ Burmeister, the Bingo-playing killer - he was quite cool!<br /><br />But in the last 10 minutes there was a little bit too much slapstick for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. That part began when ████ ██████ (as ██████ cousin ████) putted on his leather dress for █████. The "YMCA"-song didn´t fit so much here... ... but altogether, "One night at Mc Cool´s" is a pretty COOL film-noir parody!<br /><br />
