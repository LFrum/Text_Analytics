***SPOILERS*** ████ made and interesting film about the alienated youth of America back in the 1950's. Back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the hog forget that their children, especially teen-agers, needed a lot more then a car and and hefty allowance in order to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention, to their growing up problems, which is what 16 year-old ███ Ditmar, █████ █████████ never got from his successful movie producer dad Mr.Tom Ditmar, █████ Daly.<br /><br />Never really connecting with his dad ███ grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom █████ ██████, ███ ██████, as well as from society. After his dad put ███ down about him wanting to borrow his car, a late model luxury sedan, he and his friend █████, ███████ ██████, drive in ███'s beat up and barley operational 1930's jalopy to the local treater to catch the latest western flick.<br /><br />Feeling like striking out at the world ███ acts like a real first-class jerk sticking his smelly feet almost into the faces of a couple, █████ █████ & ████ ███████, sitting in front of him and █████ trying to watch the movie. This leads ███, as well as his friend █████, to not only be kicked out of the theater but with him belting the theater manager ███ ██████, ████ ███████. It turned out that at least ███ was willing to leave the theater, without even getting his money back, but when Grebbs tries to grab him ███ wheeled around and belted him right in the kisser.<br /><br />███ now in real hot water, he's charged with assault and battery, put's on his "█████ ████" act, at the local police station, making like he's either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what he's done; almost knocked ███ ██████ teeth out. It's when Sgt.Shipley, █████ ███████, tells ███ that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he's done.<br /><br />The rest of the film has ███ try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that his dad has of him. Begging his father to understand that what he did, in belting ███ ██████, was in self-defense ███'s father acts as if he's been there, at the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son ███ acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocation.<br /><br />Not excusing what ███ did, in laying out ███ ██████, he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both ███ ██████ and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked ███ and ███ ██████ in not even bothering to hear him out! Feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone, but his mom, to really turn too ███ slowly loses it only to later have both Sgt. Shipley and ███ ██████ agree to drop the assault charge. You would think that by now ███'s has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson, more then a stretch behind bars, that ███'s so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored! Being there when his son needed him most and in that ███ ██████ failed with flying colors.<br /><br />Things do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after ███ ██████ gets belted, ending up with a butte of a shiner, again by ███ who, going back to Grebbs theater, tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that ███ was only defending himself when he first, not the second time around, clobbered him. In the end ███ learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems. But most of all ███'s father ███ ██████ learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jail-keeper and a sugar daddy. Like the song says "All you need s Love" to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son ███ that ███ ██████, until the very end of the movie, lacked the most off.
