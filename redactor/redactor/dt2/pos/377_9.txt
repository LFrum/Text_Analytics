In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of ████████ █████████'s "Strangers On A Train", ███ ██████ (██████ ███████)and █████ ███████ (██████ ██████)meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders. The rather pushy ███████ suggests that he could murder ██████' unfaithful wife and ██████ could murder ███████'s domineering father. The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved. The tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going ██████ with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. Complications arise later when ███████ murders ██████' wife in an amusement park and then pursues ██████ to keep his side of the bargain.<br /><br />The differences between the two men are clear from the start. ██████ is a professional tennis player, respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas ███████'s life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling. ██████ is in a relationship with a Senator's daughter who he wants to marry. ███████ characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on ██████' part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career. The character differences are also reinforced visually. ███████ often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called "Pluto" whereas ██████ is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles.<br /><br />There are some striking visual sequences such as:- <br /><br />(1) The murder of ██████' wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from ███████.<br /><br />(2) The depiction of ███████ alone, dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white █████████ ████████ building.<br /><br />(3) The occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison, following the action, whilst one head (███████'s) chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at ██████.<br /><br />(4)The scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly.<br /><br />Frequent use is made of "doubles" throughout the story, for example, ██████ and ███████ are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train. As the train pulls out of the station, there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward. The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies. The Hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass. ██████ feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce. ██████' wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends. When ███████ confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses. ███████ later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the Senator's younger daughter who he sees as a double for ██████' wife. ███████ also feels double crossed when ██████ refuses to go ahead with the second murder. When ██████ is travelling alone in a train going to Metcalf, he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and ███████ had.<br /><br />The action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of ██████ ██████ and ████████ █████████ (as the Senator's younger daughter) are particularly powerful.
