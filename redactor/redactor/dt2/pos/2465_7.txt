██████ ███████ actually directed a good movie--who woulda thought? I sat through two previous films ███████ directed--"Wisdom" (with then girlfriend ████ █████) and "Men at Work" (with brother ███████ █████). They are lousy films---badly acted, directed, stupid and offensive. ███████ is a good actor but lousy as a director. I turned this on in pure curiousity--it has a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damned if it didn't pull me in.<br /><br />It concerns ███████ coming home from Vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there. His parents (█████ █████, ██████ █████) and sister (████████ ████████) try to reach him but can't. Something in Vietnam has affected him deeply...and he's about to explode...<br /><br />A bit overlong but still very good. A lot of the material is familar but the cast is so good that they make it seem new. ███████ is good, █████ is terrific (and ████████' real life father), ████████ is touching and █████ is just extraordinary--trying to hold the family together. It all leads up to a powerful ending which REALLY surprised me.<br /><br />Well worth catching.<br /><br />
