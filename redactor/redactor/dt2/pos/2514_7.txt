A bland title disguises this solidly-carpentered example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, this film proves a largely successful hodgepodge of several disparate elements: a period piece, a romantic drama, a crime movie and a political thriller. Interestingly, though made by ███, its protagonists  ██████ ██████ and ███████ ████████  were both usually associated with other studios; their on screen chemistry here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years' time. While a bit too young, ██████ is a dashing hero (a Marine personally appointed by President McKinley to uncover the culprits behind an organized clean-up of numerous banks); unsurprisingly, no sooner has he tracked them down (led by smooth █████ ███████ and thuggish ██████ ████████) that he falls for a chanteuse (naturally, ████████) who has thrown her lot with the gang  although, truth be told, singing is far from being the actress' forte! Similarly, apart from having to prove his worth to make it into their fold, he has to vie with McLaglen for ████████'s attentions; by the way, the practical joker persona of the former reminded me a lot of ███████ █████ in SONS OF THE DESERT (1933) which, incidentally, was likewise directed by ███████ A. Seiter. Later on, ██████ is in two minds about involving ████████ in the impending bait and tries to offer his resignation to the President while eloping with the girl  but the jealous rival disrupts his plans. The robbery gone awry, we find ███████ dead and the other two in jail; ██████'s hopes for McKinley's intervention  having meanwhile learned the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent 'inside man'  are seemingly dashed when the President winds up assassinated himself (a great plot twist, though the resulting eleventh-hour suspense feels contrived)! To get back to the film's jumble of styles, even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows things up and it skimps somewhat on the thriller aspect, this emerges a handsome production indeed  with the actors already mentioned ably supported by the likes of ████ █████████ (who unaccountably disappears after just one scene!), ███████ ██████, ███ ██████ and, as two American Presidents, ██████ ████████ (the bubbly Theodore Roosevelt) and █████ ██████ (McKinley).
