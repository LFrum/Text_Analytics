Shot entirely on location in Bulgaria, The Man With The Screaming █████ is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly-American types and a murderous hotel maid gypsy. <br /><br />███████ ████ and his wife ██████ arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and catch a cab driven by hustler █████. Things start to go awry when ██████, the maid, murders █████ and ███████ and a mad scientist implants a piece of █████'s brain in ███████'s head. ██████ eventually become involved, as do gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, █████ ████████ riding a pink █████ with prissy little streamers, and All-Of-Me-style physical comedy by a character at war with a voice in his brain who controls half of his body.<br /><br />The Man With The Screaming █████ is an incredibly funny film. It has the most hilarious tracking shot I have ever seen (when █████ ████████'s character, fresh from the lab and complete with giant forehead scar and blue hospital pajamas, runs into a square and scares a crowd of people) and a falling-down-the-steps murder scene that had the entire test screening audience screaming laughing. The whole thing is a damn riot from beginning to end and I would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy, █████ ████████, or B-movies in general.
