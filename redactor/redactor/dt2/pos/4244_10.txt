"Bride of ██████" is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90's.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />██████'s girlfriend, ███████ (Jennifer Tilly) manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park. Her neighbor, ██████ (████ ███████) and his girlfriend ████ (█████████ █████) are being tormented by her uncle. (████ ██████) ███████ upsets ██████ when he refuses to marry her, so she buys a doll for him to play with. ██████ kills ███████, and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him. In order for them to be placed back into human bodies, they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so. ██████ sees this as an opportunity to escape from ██████, and they set out on the journey, but not before ██████ is killed by ██████ and ███████. Along the way, several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast. When several more people are killed, they call up their best friend (██████ ████████) to straighten out the situation. They convince him neither one of them are the killers, as the police have began to solve the crimes. He finds ██████'s body in a trunk in the back of the van. Thinking he has been set up, he confronts them about it. ██████ and ███████ then turn real to prove they did it, which gets ████████ killed. The group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery. ██████ and ████ get ██████ and ███████ to turn on each other, giving them enough to escape. ██████ recaptures ████ and forces her to get his amulet. ██████ and ███████ restart their feud, which gives ██████ and ████ enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimes.<br /><br />The Good News: I have to give the most amount of props to the FX department, as ██████ and ███████ as dolls look completely convincing. The scenes with them together are the movies main highlights, including a hilarious conversation where ███████ advises ██████ on how serial killers in the 90's work. That being said, the amount of one-liners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible. ██████ gets the most of them, but ███████ cracks a few gems as well. It is actually funnier than what █████████ calls comedies these days. The gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic. Several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative. Turning ██████ into a new form of ███████ was a totally brilliant scene. The honeymooning couple was a nice death scene, as well. For teenage love, the pairing of Stabile and █████ works great. They have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple. I also have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, I did jump during certain scenes, and that shows what an incredible job director ██ did. He learned enough, apparently, to do the same thing with "Freddy vs. █████." He knows how to stage set-ups and pay-offs, and here he shows some great skills that have a Hong Kong influenced look and style. He could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two. Nice soundtrack, too, like "Freddy vs. █████."<br /><br />The Bad News: For fans of cheesy movies, this will be a great find. However, this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film. The film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it, making a serious fan turned off because of things like the one-liners. It isn't all that bad of a movie, but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie, and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie, not to take it away. Remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie.<br /><br />The Final Verdict: Fans of cheesy movies and the other "Child's Play" movies will find a lot to like about this movie. For serious horror fans, take a look at it, but keep in mind that it isn't a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it.<br /><br />Rated R: ███████ ████████, ███████ ████████, █████ ██████ on a doll, a shadowy puppet sex scene, some drug use, and numerous drug references.
