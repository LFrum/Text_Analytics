Just saw ████ ████ ██████ again after 30 years. I still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever. The innocence and purity of a time now long gone, is truthfully captured in this small film. The acting is above average and ███████ ████'s brief appearance as a shell-shocked ██████ ██████ war hero, holds a keen interest for any film buff or Gere fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the "All-American" boy. The late █████ █████ (who was billed as B.Kirby, Jr.) has a meaty role as "Pop", a peace-loving, ██████ ████ reject, dreaming of getting back home to his wife. If you're looking for sex, drugs, or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. If you're looking for action and adventure, the same applies. However, if you want to recapture a time in America of innocence, honor, romance, and love, then ████ ████ ██████ is a movie for you.
