Don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. It has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking ████, and some nice music. And the standout scene was definitely █████, ████ and █████'s dance on the floor, that was such a nice and fun touch. As a matter of fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but all in all it is not what I call exceptional like ████████████. There are some very nice gags, but they have been used before I feel, and there wasn't much that I would deem hilarious. And █████ joining forces with █████? Somehow seeing as he was a target of the hunter, didn't it seem odd that he would be friends with him. Though I will admit it was nice having █████ there. The voice acting was above average too, but somehow I missed ███ █████ █<br /><br />All in all, unexceptional but very nice cartoon. 7/10 Bethany Cox
