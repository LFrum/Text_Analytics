Having long disdained network television programming, I remember the first time I caught an episode of "Police Squad!". It was totally by accident. It was during the show's initial network run on ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping the dial one evening when suddenly appeared "Police Squad!"'s opening credit sequence on my TV screen. I immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of "M-Squad" starring ███ ██████, one of my all-time favorite cop shows. I stopped surfing. Then of course came headquarters getting shot up, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as ███████ ███████. By now I was saying to myself "What the heck is THIS??". Then came "special guest star" █████ ████████ █████ getting flattened by a plummeting safe. I was hooked from that moment. The episode was "Ring of Fear/A █████████ ██████████", with its comic references to "On The Waterfront", and "████████ ███", but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs. ██████ Nielsen and ████ █████ in their loose parody of ███ ██████ and ████ ██████ of "M Squad" were an absolute riot. "Finally", I said to myself, "A network television program truly worth watching!!!". Wouldn't you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later. Leave it to the networks -- I should have known. Anyway, I just bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago. The "Naked Gun" movies were terrific as well, but I really missed ████ █████ (he was so good as ██ ██████), █████ █████ as Nordberg (what were they thinking casting OJ in that part?), and especially ███████ █████'s "██████" the shoeshine guy. Great stuff.
