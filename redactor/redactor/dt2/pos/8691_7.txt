Why ██████ ████████, one of Britains top musical stars, was in this movie in between her sparkling "The Good Companions" and the classic "Evergreen" is a good question? When I first saw it I was really disappointed. I wanted to see her sing and dance - she was billed as "██████ - the non - stop variety girl" but there was more stop than variety.<br /><br />Now I see it as a good little drama.<br /><br />It is about a bus crash and the stories, leading up to it, of the people on the bus.<br /><br />Apart from ██████ ████████, who is great as ██████ - ███ █████ ██████████ plays her fiancée ( yes, that's right).<br /><br />Edmund █████ - who went to Hollywood to co-star in Lassie movies and also with ███████ ████ in "███████ on 34th Street", plays a grumpy businessman. ██████ ██████ is his very annoying partner.<br /><br />Emlyn ████████ - who wrote "█████ ████ ████" was the black - mailing villain and █████ ██████, who went to Hollywood and appeared in "█████ ███████████" and "The Devil Doll" is the young man in trouble. ██████ Hale who was married to ██████ ████████ at the time played the bus conductor.
