Came across this film recently after so long hearing about it. It is an excellent not pretentious movie for people who loves film noir literature and films. Not "camp" but humorous. <br /><br />GREAT CAST! From the magnificent █████ ██████ and ████ ████████ to German superstar ███ █████████, this movie is a feast for the eyes. ████ ███████ is very funny as the antagonist of gang. Would love to see spin off movie with this character and ████ ████████ solving cases and arguments between them all the time (much like █████ and ███████, etc.)<br /><br />Intelligent story, nice twists and scope photography (don't watch unless it is scope because compositions are very rich).<br /><br />Sexy sexy sexy and very fun time.<br /><br />Best use of Just Like Heaven by The Cure ever (must see to believe!)<br /><br />********
