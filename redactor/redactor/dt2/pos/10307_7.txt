The film's subject is poignant and very real. It happened. One can debate some artistic liberties taken by director and scriptwriter. The subject is what makes the film tick--nothing else. I saw the film for the first time after the real ███████, was gunned down in New Delhi and had served several years as an elected Member of Parliament in India. By the way, she was not the first untouchable elected to Parliament, as some reviewers stated. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected to the Indian Parliament for decades in reserved constituencies.<br /><br />While ███████ █████ as a director is a hero to many India, because he made commercially accepted international films---"██████ █████" and "█████████" (and a tolerable kiddie movie called "██████ █████", which was accepted by the average Indian audiences)---and even got Oscar nominations for █████████, I do not place him as a top notch film director from India. He fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some above-average performances from his actors. Subtlety, finesse, charm are not easy to find in his films--melodrama brims in them.<br /><br />His idea of using ██████ █████ ███ ████'s vocal rendering of the song in the early parts of the film, was perhaps his single major achievement on the undistinguished sound track of "██████ █████". And then perhaps the creaking doors during the gang rape sequence. Otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music one associates with them. <br /><br />If you are looking for a good living Indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international quality--it is not ███████ █████'s movies you should see; it is the later works of three Indian film-makers █████ ██████████████, ██████ ███, and ██████ ██████ and of course ████████ ███'s "█████ ████". It is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that █████ had to give them and their films an international viewership. For instance, Sen's "Oka oorie katha" made in Telugu, or ████████ ███'s "███████" based on ██████ ████ █████'s "Kafan" are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing on the state of the untouchables in India. Sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but merely suggested them. Of course, Sen's nugget did not make headlines, while █████'s effort hogged them.<br /><br />To █████'s credit, he is articulate and used his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to take his products beyond home audiences. For that effort, I salute █████. But "██████ █████" will remain a great subject awaiting an accomplished director to deal with it.
