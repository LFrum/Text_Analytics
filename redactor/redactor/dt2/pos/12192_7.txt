Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie. In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this ██████ (██████ ████████) better than ██████'s attempt. All the major players from the series were present: ██████, ██████, Armand, Maharet, ███████, ███████, Mael, ██████ and a half-dozen more (albeit most of them in cameo). ██████, ██████ and ██████ were the main players (and █████ of the Talamasca). Also, despite other reviews, I think this movie and the music was faithful to ████ ████'s portrayal and ethos, at least as I perceive it. ████████ was pretty good as ██████, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene). The movie didn't capture the breadth of the books series but I thought it was a nice supplement.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to ████ ████'s style, sensitivities and treatments. And I found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.
