I've always liked ████ ███████, but as █████ ████ I've always favored █████ █████. Still it was ███████ who set the Bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than █████ ████, the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of Spectre.<br /><br />And what designs they are in Never Say Never Again. SPECTRE with the help of a foolish young ███ █████ officer who happens to be ███ █████████'s brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now SPECTRE headed by ███████, played here by ███ ███ █████ is threatening blackmail of the world.<br /><br />Von █████'s operations guy is █████ █████ █████████ who is also courting █████████ and is a bit on the crazy side. And he's got a female assassin working for him in Barbara ███████ who makes ████████ █████ as ████ █████ look like Mrs. Butterworth.<br /><br />But before ████ ███████ can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'M' running things at British Intelligence. ██████ ███ thinks ███████ is old fashioned in his methods and costs the British taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. I really did enjoy ███'s performance, he's like the great grandson of Colonel Blimp.<br /><br />I also enjoyed ███████, she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. When she's scuba diving with ███████ in the Bahamas, note how she puts ███ █████ on 007's case.<br /><br />████ ███████ do █████ ████ again? He was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point, █████ █████'s father? But I think ███████ would still be formidable in a wheelchair.
