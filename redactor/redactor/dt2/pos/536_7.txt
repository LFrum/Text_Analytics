Since I am a fan of ███████ ███████, I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if ███████ was the mother and █████ was the mother. █████'s character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it.<br /><br />I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving ███████ and some-guy (he's in Outside Providence) but ███████ would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that is great. I think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film.<br /><br />███████ must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because I haven't seen her in a bad film yet. So, any movie that has ███████ ███████ will no doubt be seen by me.<br /><br />A good film. 7/10
