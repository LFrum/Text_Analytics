It seems that ████ has been described as un-realistic... but that's what TV is. TV is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and I feel ████ does a great job in that regard. Add to this the slow process of revealing his past and engaging/interesting plots; you just can't seem to get enough. Plus, with such great actors as █████ █████, █████ ████████, and even little ██████ ██████, what more can you ask for. So if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for "underdog" characters, I suggest giving ████ a chance, especially now that it's finally getting off its feet.
