A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, █████████ █████ (Jennifer Lopez) who is desperately urged by two FBI agents, █████ █████ (Vince Vaughn) and ██████ ██████ (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on ████ ████████ (Vincent D'Ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and horrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. What █████ wants in return from █████ is whereabouts of ████████'s latest victim is and if she's alive. Once █████ gets into ████████'s mind, which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of █████ █████'s "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and ███ ██████'s "A Nightmare on Elm Street", the adventure begins. █████ sees a variety of odd people ranging from Carl as a youngster (an adorable ████ ██████) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the razor claws. I don't want to give away the ending, but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances, ██████ █████'s creepy musical score and directing (by ██████, who shows here that he can direct).
