I'm not saying anything new when I say that "Ray" was magnificent. As I proceed to laud this movie I have to mention something that sets it apart from other films. Very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor(s). "Ray" quite simply was made by █████ ████. Without the wonderful performance of █████ ████, "Ray" would just be another interesting and informative biopic. I always thought ████ was funny, stemming from his days with "In Livin' Color" and "The █████ ████ Show", and I also knew that he was talented, as he used his own show ("The █████ ████ Show") to show off his musical talents. But never did I imagine that he could pull off a role like this. I don't know much about acting and what they go through to get into character or other things like that, but what I saw from █████ ████ was extremely impressive. He wrapped himself into that role and made us see ███ ███████ rather than an actor portraying ███ ███████. The story of "Ray" was great yes, but it was given life by █████ ████.
