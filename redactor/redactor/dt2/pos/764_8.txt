I, being a fan of ██████ █████, rented this film a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining, and showed that ██████ █████ could play more than his most well known character of ███ ███████. His subtle portrayal of ███ and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable.<br /><br />███, a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the, I guess you could call "assistant" to Evie, a retired actress. At first, it is just a way for him to earn some money. But after a while, he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps ███ break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself, and in the end they both seem to need each other.<br /><br />Whether you are a fan of ██████ █████ or not, this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.
