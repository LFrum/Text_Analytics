█████████ Bardot, looking as sexy as ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a French Ambassador. She cons one of her father's top aides (womanizer MICHEL) into marrying her and it turns out to be the best thing for both of them. ██████ is soon flirting with his old girlfriends and in order to teach him a lesson, █████████ flirts heavily with a married PRINCE CHARLES. ██████ is surprised by his jealousy. A cat-and-mouse game ensues between Brigdette and ██████ ("I'll have an affair"..."No you won't"...) And finally ██████ realizes she just might and vows to give up all the other ladies in his life. █████████ and ██████ settle comfortably into their happily-ever-after while ██████ ███████ jets home to England.<br /><br />It's an admittedly light piece but it's incredibly charming. While some may fault it as a product of it's time, I found that completely enjoyable. Worthy of a rental.
