House of ███████ was made towards the end of Universal's horror cycle of the 1940's and I've seen this a couple of times.<br /><br />A mad Doctor, ███████ is breeding plants for a serum that cures people. █████ ███████ arrives for a cure for his vampirism and ████████ ██████ then comes to see if he can cure him from turning into a werewolf at full moon. ████████████'s monster is then discovered and ███████ brings him back to life just as the villagers descend on the castle and set it on fire. Talbot, now cured and one of ███████'s female assistants are safe though.<br /><br />Like a lot of movies of its kind, we have a hunchback assistant and thunderstorm to keep it moving.<br /><br />The cast includes Universal horror regulars ███ ██████ ██ (The Wolf Man), ████ █████████ (House of ████████████) and █████ ███████ as ████████████'s monster. Also starring ██████ ███████ (Them!), ██████ ██████ (The Vampire Bat) and ██████ O'Driscoll .<br /><br />House of ███████ is a must see for all old horror fans out there. Great fun.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
