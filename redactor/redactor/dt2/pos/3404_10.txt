I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved ████ and ██████'s relationship so much. I was so enraptured in ████ and █████████'s love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved ███████ in this movie. I just bought all three books together and I can't stop watching them. My 12 year old son is stuck on it. He likes the fighting in the war. I cry every time. I wish I could meet ███████ and Madeline in person! It was a wonderful movie and cast!
