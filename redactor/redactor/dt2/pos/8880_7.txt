I am surprised people, after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7.0's, I thought more people would get a kick out of "█████ █████ from the Train". This was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors, █████ ███████ and █████ ██████. Together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession. █████ is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead, █████ has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him. When █████ gives some "misunderstood" advice to █████, █████ offers a proposition to █████, if he kills his ex wife, █████ has to kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh. Please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! It's a good one!<br /><br />7/10
