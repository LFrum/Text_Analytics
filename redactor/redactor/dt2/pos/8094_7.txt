Written, produced and directed by ███████ ███████, this is the great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda piece, skewering █████ ██████.<br /><br />███████ plays ███████ ███████, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is ███████'s spitting image. His parody of ██████ is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen newsreels of ██████ speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature. <br /><br />I thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical ███████ slap-stick focussing on the First World War adventures of the Jewish barber. Having never seen it before I must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so I was wondering what all the fuss was about. But the movie picks up steam quickly. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of "███████-ism" to make the propaganda point. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by ███████ at the end of the movie.<br /><br />As good as ███████ is in this movie, though, I thought the whole thing was stolen by ████ █████, playing the dictator of "Bacteria" - "███████ ████████." Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had █████████'s arrogant posturing down pat. The scenes in which ███████ and Napaloni negotiate over the fate of "█████████" had me in stitches.<br /><br />This was a very good movie, and well worth watching.
