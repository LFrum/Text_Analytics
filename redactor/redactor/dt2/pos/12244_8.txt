I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It gives such detail of what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air: notably ████ █████ rushing █████ to finish editing the piece to get it off, and then ████ ██████ struggling to get it in, and ███████ ████, who according to ████ commits an incredible breach of ethics, fakes his tears during his date rape interview, a flaw that is pointed out by █████. Another high point is when ███ uses ████ for his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with ████████. The script is brilliant, and the directing is almost as good. All three main actors were great in the portrayals of their characters, ██████████ █████ ██████, and ██████ ██████, whom is the funniest in the film. ███████ ████ is also very good. This deserved at least three Oscars, best actress(holly hunter), best supporting actor (██████ ██████), and best picture. I liked the last parts of the film where it shows them reuniting 7 years later.<br /><br />8/10
