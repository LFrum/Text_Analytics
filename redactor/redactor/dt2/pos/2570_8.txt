I actually though that █████ █████ ████ was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named ███████ whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds ███ abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. ███████ finds out that ███ is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up ███ with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. ██████ L ███████ and █████████ █████ have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that ███████ and ███ become best friends. I was also amazed by ███'s ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing. S ██████ ██████████ is great as ███████' love interest ██████, ██████ ██████████ plays ███'s boyfriend ██████ who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance.
