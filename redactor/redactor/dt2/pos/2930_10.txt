This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically ███████ sees at a toy store a kid who has the ████████'s syndrome and a new idea comes to ███████. You can imagine, now ███████ has ████████'s syndrome and is great since ████ once he knows about this is like "he's faking". ███████ is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody. On the other hand we have ████ who now is the intolerant one, basically for saying that ███████ was faking he was taken to meet children with ████████'s syndrome just to let him see that ████████'s syndrome is for real and is great since ████ is like "well maybe someone is faking to have ████████'s for fun", in short ████ could not explain that ███████ was faking. Probably my favourite scene of this episode is when ███████ is with ████'s family but right after this scene another kid fins that ███████ is simply faking, the kid with ████████'s who was at the toy store, ███████ basically said to that kid this: "isn't having ████████'s awesome". But to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for ███████, his master plan: going on National TV to say anything he wants ("people will call it brilliant TV, they'll probably give me an Emmy"- fantastic, in this episode the word "s***" is used 26 times and certainly that's not all. South ████ won an Emmy like a month or so before this episode aired). But here there's a twist, ███████ basically removed all the bricks of the wall, he says now everything without thinking so we hear from ███████ that he wet his bed last night, now is not fun for ███████ and he is like "I can't control what I say" and certainly the person who was with him is like "well of course you can't control what you say, you have ████████'s" so ███████ is like "my ████████'s has gotten worse, before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff but now it's gotten really bad". There is also stuff about █████ ██████ and To Catch a Predator, actually what happened with a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts, ████ and ██████ were behind that to stop ███████, ████ ends being ███████'s saviour! Fantastic!<br /><br />TSA VOICES CONCERN Over "South ████" October 3rd ███████ <br /><br />On Wednesday, October 3, the cable network Comedy Central will air an episode of the animated series "South ████" in which one of the young characters, ███████, "gets" ████████ ████████. Given the nature of this program, we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and garner numerous calls and emails from our members and the TS community.<br /><br />We have already taken some pre-emptive strikes, such as requesting that Comedy Central air our Public Service Announcement (featuring comedian ███████ █████) during or after the show. In addition, once the episode airs and we are able to see exactly how TS is portrayed, we will be able to respond with specific issues and problems we have with the show to the writers.<br /><br />"We are actually surprised it took the creators so long to use TS as comedy fodder in this program, since no disability, illness or controversial topic is off limits to them," said █████ █████, President, TSA.<br /><br />"We always see portrayals of TS (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for TSA to spread factual information about the disorder," said █████ Colletti- Flynn, ███████ of Public Relations and Communications, TSA.<br /><br />We will be posting an official statement on this site with TSA's reaction to the program after the show airs.<br /><br />TSA RESPONDS to "South ████" ███████ <br /><br />Unfortunately, as has been the case with far too many media portrayals of people with ████████ ████████ (TS), the season opener of South ████ ("██ █████ ████████," 10-3-07) served to perpetuate even further the outright myth that most of those affected by TS have involuntary outbursts of foul language. In point of fact, fully 85-90% of people with TS never experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (medically termed coprolalia). For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the misleading take away message couldn't have been clearer  unless you curse, you don't have TS. <br /><br />Despite our pre-airing trepidations, we do concede that the episode was surprisingly well- researched. The highly exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia notwithstanding, for the attentive viewer, there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed. The scripted input from parents, a neurologist, peers and the therapy session with the "TS children's support group" all served as a clever device for providing these facts to the public. "No doubt this South ████ episode did generate increased national awareness about TS. Nevertheless, we are very concerned that school children with TS will be mocked and even bullied by insensitive peers who may have seen the program," said █████ █████, TSA President. "We realize that for over a decade the writers' satirical parodies have spared no group be they celebrities, the disabled or political figures. The fact that TS was the subject of a popular TV show attests to the fact that the public is so much more aware of the disorder. Obviously, this increased awareness we've worked too hard to accomplish can at times prove to be a double-edged sword." <br /><br />TSA contacted the program's executives prior to the airing, and we will be in touch with them again. Perhaps we'll succeed in turning this into an opportunity for positive TS awareness.
