I just got this movie for █████████ and have already added it to my favorites list. A cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie. Who could not love █████ █████ or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food. Definite points go to ██████ ███████████ for his performance of █████████ ███████ and also to ████████ ████████ who played ████ ██████, the impossibly boring fiancee. Truly a gem to be watched every █████████.
