Extremely entertaining mid-1950's western that packs a whole lot into just a 96-minute running time. Most viewers will quickly get drawn into this story and will find the experience quite enjoyable. More than just a B-Western but not really an epic, the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite several big names. █████ Ford was the only box office draw at the time. ██████ G. ████████ and ███████ ████████ were past their primes and looking for work, ████████ was 10 years away from a new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian █████ and ██████ ██████ were just starting out.<br /><br />Ford plays ████ ███████, a small rancher who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the big rancher's (████████) hired gunman. Parrish is a former Confederate officer who only moved out west for health reasons. <br /><br />████████ plays ███ ████████, who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest, making good on a promise to his wife ██████ (████████). ███ was crippled in a land war he fought 12 years earlier; his brother Cole (█████) has come up from Texas to help him run the huge spread. ███ has been turning a blind eye to obvious hookups between ████████ and █████ but sensitive daughter ██████ (██████) is understandably upset by what is going on in their home. <br /><br />████ ███████ has promised his fiancée Caroline (May Winn) that he will move back east. Caroline, who is modeled on █████ █████'s "████ ████" character, breaks off the engagement at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the film. This leaves the way open for a ████ and ██████ romance to develop. <br /><br />The violence starts early and continues throughout the film, with Parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main gunfighter about midway into the film. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self- deprecating manner, who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked (very much like his role in "The Sheepman"). <br /><br />████████ is likewise excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically just a shadow of his former self. And he gets enough lines and screen time to adequately develop his character. <br /><br />████████ has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two-faced woman, a seemingly loyal wife who is scheming to replace her husband with his brother. In part this is because she is not allocated enough time to do anything more than superficially convey either side of the character. That said, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations.<br /><br />██████ ██████ is a pleasant surprise. She should remind viewers a lot of ███████ █████, both physically and in acting style. Although required to play ██████ according to 1950's convention (she is allowed to be tough but then required to break into hysterics after each major confrontation), ██████ shows a nice range. She conveys a growing attraction for Parrish but does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues click into place. <br /><br />The real problem with "The Violent Men" is that it tries to be both an action western and a character study morality play. Because so much has to happen on the screen much of the action is rushed and many of the characters get only a cursory treatment. This is neither fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like Caroline.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
