I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since ████ ████ ███████ ███. Both shows sold out, and for good reason. The Man With the Screaming █████ was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) <br /><br />█████ ████████ was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. It may be the funniest movie that █████ has done. ███ █████ steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot! Who knew that ███ could rap? <br /><br />I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There is nothing funnier than a robot...doing the robot.<br /><br />As for █████'s performance: "I take the 5th." Thanks █████. Thanks for being cool, thanks for taking the time, thanks for all of the fun.
