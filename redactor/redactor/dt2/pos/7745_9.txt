I've rented this gem several times! It's a small, yet somehow sprawling masterpiece taking the viewer from Manhattan glitz to the beauty of the Greek islands. ████ ██████████ on-screen marriage to his real-life wife ████ ████████ is on the rocks. He finds meaning in a fling with footloose █████ ████████ whom he finds in Greece while their daughter, played in her earliest film role by the pubescent █████ ████████, falls for the son of the Greek shipping tycoon who is courting her mother on a yacht sailing in neighboring waters. Meanwhile, the immensely talented ████ █████ plays a goatherd living in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the "hots" for █████ ████████'s character until confronted by ████ ██████████. All comes together at the end in a classic closing scene where all is reconciled. ████ █████, the goatherd, is seen dancing with his goat. This film is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sexiness, and more. See it!
