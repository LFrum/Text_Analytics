I love those kind of movies. Blood, ███████, A Lot of Action, ████ ████, Cheesy and More. But this one doesn't deliver the genre that you might expect. When I saw ████ █████ and Ichi the Killer before, I had fun watching those but why this one not? ████ or Alive: Final is a decent anime and its not hardcore and don't even expect nudity in this movie.At least add some more action to entertain the audience. Even the drama wasn't that good. Well, I don't want to spoil the movie nor the plot.But I felt that ████ or Alive: Final is a bit nerdy. So, without further to do. I don't recommend this movie to everyone but I recommend for the people who love decent and well directed anime.<br /><br />Dr ███████ ██████████, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 ████████ ████████
