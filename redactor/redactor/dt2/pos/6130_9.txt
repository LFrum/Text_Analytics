"Pink █████████" is a cult classic.The plot of this film revolves around the throwdown challenge to ██████'s supremacy as the filthiest person alive."Pink █████████" contains some memorably repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where ██████ eats fresh dog feces.Yes,the movie is shocking and funny at the same time,but the biggest laughs come from the actors' lines.Check out especially this line from ██████:"Kill everyone now!Condone first degree murder!Advocate cannibalism!Eat s***!█████ is my politics!█████ is my life!".On the whole,I really enjoyed this film.Still its tagline "An Exercise in Bad Taste" should be taken to heart and even those used to the gross out movies today may find this gem hard to stomach.Highly recommended.
