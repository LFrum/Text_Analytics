This was the best film I saw in the year 2000. The █████ brothers have never let me down before, and they certainly didn't this time either.<br /><br />It's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent and vastly entertaining. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there's lot of █████ stuff in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magic camerawork. But no █████ film is resembling any other █████ film, if you overlook the general quality of them, of course.<br /><br />The big surprise for me was that ███████ is so good. But the true master performance in this movie comes from ███ ████████████. But the rest of the cast is superb too.<br /><br />A film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence. Thats a very unlikely combination. But it's exactly what this picture is.
