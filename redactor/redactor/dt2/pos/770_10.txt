After seeing the Harry Potter movies, I've been a fan of the trio actors ██████ █████, ██████ █████████ and ████ ██████; yet, we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on ██████ and ████, being that they're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving ██████ dead-end. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and ██████'s light hits him for once in this movie.<br /><br />"Driving ███████" is called the Harold and █████ of this generation with ██████ █████ playing the role of ███ ████████, a young British lad who lives with his domineering mother (█████ ██████) and a wimp of a vicar (priest) father for which he wants a job in the summer but can't find work while at the same time taking his driving tests (and failing) and writing poetry for a young girl who doesn't have any interest in him.<br /><br />███ seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady. He takes the job and realizes that he's in for a fun of surprises as ████ (█████ ███████, ██████'s mother in the Harry Potter series) an out-of-work actress who is also a poet giving ███ the run for his money. They bond where and tell each other secrets along with ████ acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags ███ along for a country road trip. From their not only does ███ drive all the way from Britain to Scotland since ████ needs to recite at a local library, but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which ███ starts becoming a man.<br /><br />There is mishap and at the same time rejoice with ███ and ████ along with saying that I was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and I was impressed with ██████ █████'s acting, especially if he showed the rest of the world that even though he brings a bit of ███ ███████ within ███ ████████, there's no stopping the actor on his brilliant performance.
