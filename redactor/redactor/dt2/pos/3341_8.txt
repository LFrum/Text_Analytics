This movie was released originally as a soft "X", apparently with the explicit sex deleted. Later, the producers "relented" (smelled money) and re-released it with the excised scenes restored (apparently only about 3 minutes). I guess since ████████ was of age, it was held against her and her promising career came grinding to a halt. I guess its all in the timing (witness ███ ████████'s career)--but ██████ ██████ was in charge during ████████'s debacle (we had not heard about █████ ██████'s affairs), ████ ███████ and ██████ ████████ were in full swing during ███'s "coming out".<br /><br />The sex is just icing on the cake, both version satisfy. This naughty musical is way above similar of others that were released at the same time.
