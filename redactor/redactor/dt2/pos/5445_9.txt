I completely disagree with the other comments! I too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable. █████ ████████ is in top form. True, the tone is familiar, but it is ████████ of Good Morning Vietnam: smart, funny, on point. After too many dark turns, ████████ is finally back to what he does best. The supporting actors give great performances, especially █████ ██████ and █████ ██████. Chris plays himself, as usual, but as the "agent" to the next president he was a delight each time on screen. █████ Black plays only himself basically, but he is wonderfully well used here. There is also a fun turn by ████ ████████. The movie is more than what the trailer suggests, as well. The movie is funny, but it is not a pure comedy as suggested. It has a bit of a thriller line, which everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
