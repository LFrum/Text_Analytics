This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. The glorious Technicolor shows off ████ ████████'s beauty and spectacular hair. She should have made more movies in color, but then ████████ was hardly in a position to splash out money for Technicolor spectaculars.<br /><br />████ is a WOW as █████ ██████ - she more than keeps up with ████ in some of the most sparkling numbers ever. She also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns, so she was given a chance to play her own grandmother.<br /><br />The film opens with "The Show Must Go On" - it looks great to me - but █████ ███████ (████ Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work, work, work!!! One of the dancers, ███████ (██████ ███████) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for Vanity's Golden Wedding █████ ████ Competition. Rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well. In a very funny scene ███████ has just had a so so audition and seeing Rusty, gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!! "Don't be shy and demure - chatter and sparkle". Rusty does so with gusto!!!<br /><br />They decide on ███████ and go to the show to see her but ████ ███████ (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) is still having nightmares over Rusty's audition. "Whose Complaining" features Genius (████ ███████) and the dancers, dressed up as working girls - (Rusty is a cabbie).<br /><br />████ is remembering a long lost love (Rusty's grandmother, █████████ █████) the first time he saw her singing "A Sure Thing" - set at the races. Meanwhile █████, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local diner. They then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "Make Way For ████████".<br /><br />"Put Me to the Test" is a spirited song and dance number featuring █████ and Rusty. In the meantime Rusty has been chosen █████ ████ and █████ ████████' is the place to be seen. ███ ██████ appears as █████'s romantic rival and puts a damper on things. ███ ██████ is probably the most boring leading man ever - so █████ never needs to worry.<br /><br />Rusty (dubbed by ██████ █████) sings "Long Ago and ███ ████" and it is danced beautifully by █████ and Rusty. The gowns that ████ wears are stunning. ██████ Banton and ████ ████████ designed them. █████ wants the best for Rusty but is afraid he will lose her. ████ Kelly is also fantastic in the "Alter Ego" number where he dances with himself.<br /><br />"████ ████" is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - Hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit. Look for ██ ██████ in both "████ ████" and "A Sure Thing". He was an amazing eccentric dancer, who appeared in several early musicals, including "King of Jazz" and "█████████ on Parade". He was easy to spot.<br /><br />The "█████ ████" dance is just wonderful. ████ was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. After a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of America's top magazines, Rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy "█████ ████" song. Gosh I just LOVE this movie!!!!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
