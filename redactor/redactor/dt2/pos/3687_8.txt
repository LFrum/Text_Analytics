Minor Spoilers<br /><br />In Chicago, █████ ███████ (█████ █████) is a housewife having a twenty-five years marriage with the lawyer ███ ███████ (███ ███████) and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf daughter-in-law, ██████ (Meredith Eaton). Grace worships the singer ██████ ███ (████████ █████), who will present a TV show in Chicago and will give five spots on the first row in a TV promotion. Kate calls the show and wins a ticket, when ███ simultaneously asks for the divorce, claiming that their lives are too monotonous. Grace becomes depressed, and when she goes to the show, the audience is informed that a Chicago serial killer, who uses a crossbow, killed ██████ ███. With a broken heart, she decides to fly to England to ██████ ███'s funeral. There, she realizes that he was gay, and becomes friend of his former mate ████ ███████ (██████ ███████). They fly back to Chicago, trying to find the killer. This movie is a delightful, original and weird dramatic comedy, having bizarre characters. It has a huge potential to be a cult-movie, with the presences of █████ ███████ and █████ ███████ themselves and a joke with ███████ ████'s masterpiece 'Don't Look Now', when ██████ wears a red raincoat in Chicago's underground part of the city. The beginning of the movie, with ████████ █████ singing 'Hitchcock ███████', is wonderful. I have repeated it four consecutive times. The cast has a magnificent performance, highlighting █████ █████, ████████ █████, ██████ ███████ and the unknown Meredith Eaton. Indeed, this movie is an excellent entertainment. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Amor a Toda Prova' ('Love to the Proof')
