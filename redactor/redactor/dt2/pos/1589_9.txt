This is a ravishing, yet spare adaption of ██████ ████'s novelette of the same title. ████ Bogarde gives his finest screen performance - he himself believed so. The dialogue is minimal, so his face must register the nuances of his anguished character - a composer (a writer in the novelette - the only major alteration) who travels to Venice in 1910. ████████ revels in the portrayal of beauty, it's passing, and the whiff of decay beneath.Trained as an opera director, ████████ blends ██████'s music and imagery seamlessly in his finest film since "The Leopard" (another stunning film, which greatly influenced ███████'s Sicily in the "Godfather").
