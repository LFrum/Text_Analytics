After winning a championship fight, boxer ████ ████████ (as ███████ █████████) celebrates with a drinking binge, which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. Although his manager killed the man, ███ ████████ is blamed. When the manager dies in a car crash, wearing ████████'s stolen watch, authorities think the boxer is dead. Still a WANTED man, ████████ changes his identity to "████ ██████" and moves to an Arizona ranch. There, ████████ meets "The Dead End Kids": █████ █████ (as █████), █████ ██████ (as Angel), ███ ██████ (as Spit), █████ ████ (as Dippy), ███████ ████ (as T.B.), and ███████ ██████ (as ████).<br /><br />████████ bonds with the young "Dead End" lads, who were sent to stay with sweet "███████ ████████" (May ██████) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother, deceased priest "██████ ████████". ████████ falls in love with █████'s sister, pretty "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to keep any eye on the kids. Of course, ████████'s past comes back to haunt him <br /><br />"████ ████████ and The 'Dead End' Kids" make beautiful (Max Steiner) music together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by █████ ████████ and █████ ████ ████. The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers support team in fine form. ████████ and the "Dead End" kids are a winning combination; although ████████ made no further movies with the "████ ████" gang, the studio had him re-team with both █████ █████ and █████ ██████, almost immediately, for "Dust Be My Destiny".<br /><br />The boxing scenes are nicely staged. But, the most exciting sequence has ████████ and four of the New York "Kids" (█████, Jordan, Hall, and Punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger. Other, more brief, highlights include floozy ███ ████████ (as Goldie), boozy ███████ ██████ (as Budgie), and young ██████ ████████ (as Douglas) losing at strip poker.<br /><br />******** They Made Me a Criminal (1/21/39) █████ ████████ ~ ████ ████████, █████ █████, █████ ██████
