I've watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life, and it never gets old. For all the snide remarks and insults (mostly from █████ █████), "█████ ███" has a giant heart. And that's what keeps this movie funny after all these years.<br /><br />█████ ████████ (█████ ██████) is the son of Big ███ ████████ (█████ ███████), master car parts salesman, and has ridden on that all his life. But after his died dies on his wedding day, █████ learns that the company is in debt, and about to be bought by ███ ████████ (███ ██████), the owner of a huge car parts company. So in order to save the company, █████ has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. Along for the ride, though not by choice, is ███████ ██████ (█████ █████) a former classmate of █████'s who was Big ███'s right-hand man.<br /><br />The movie rides on the chemistry between the two SNL stars (and real-life best friends) █████ ██████ and █████ █████. The duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world. It's the big, dumb guy versus the smart little guy. It works, and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. ██████ and █████ are actually decent dramatic actors as well. Although the film is primarily a comedy, it has its fair share of drama, but █████ and especially ██████ are just as good there as when they're making the audience laugh.<br /><br />Forgive me, but I have to talk about █████ ██████ a little more. I read his biography ("The █████ ██████ Show: A Biography in Three Acts," for anyone who cares), and understanding who █████ was in real life made this movie more special to me. █████ ██████ was a genuinely good person who struggled, and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions. Although this was the first movie he had a major role in, it is his best film. It really showed who he was, and just how much talent he had. Knowing █████'s story adds another layer to this movie, although it doesn't make it any less funny.<br /><br />██████ and █████ are matched with a good on screen cast. ███ Lowe is suitably slimy as █████'s "new brother," and ██ █████ is solid as his step-mother. █████ ███████ is great as Big ███. ███████ makes it easy to believe that they're father in son. Big ███ is just as crazy as his son, although he's smarter and more mature. ███ ██████ gives one of his best performances as ████████, giving █████ the hard truth behind advertising. █████ ██████ is also good as █████'s love interest, Michelle.<br /><br />For me, █████ █████ is one of the great comedy directors. He keeps the pace quick and energetic, but most importantly, he knows how to make comedy funny. He doesn't belabor the jokes, and he understands that funny actors know what they're doing and he allows them to do it. But █████ goes a step further. He gives "█████ ███" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings (genuinely) and tickles the funnybone.<br /><br />Critics didn't like "█████ ███." Shame on them. A movie doesn't have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (God forbid ██████ and █████ were forced to do muted comedy a la "The Office"). This is a great movie and one of my all-time favorites.
