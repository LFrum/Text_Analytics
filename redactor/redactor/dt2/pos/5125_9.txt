The story is incredible, it begins with a new kid in town named ███, while on the bus to school, he notices a kid running with no shoes, and on that same day he breaks the big bullies nose who is trying to fight with him. ███ soon discovers that kid is a runaway, and he and his step sister are trying to mess a construction sight, that could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. ███ decides to help them him there fight, Can they win this fight before the smart but bumbling cop ████ ███████(████ ██████) Stumbles on to them. An enjoyable film, funny and adventurous. I do admire ████ ██████ for taking this role. I don't think his brother ████ would even take this role.
