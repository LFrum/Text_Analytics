He plays the highly intelligent prankster, █████ ██████ along with ███ ███████ and █████ ██████ who play his best friends, ████ ██████ and ████████ "██████" █████████. During a regular day at █████ ██████'s school for boys, a group of dangerous terrorists take all the boys and teachers as hostages and threatens to blow up the school if the leader, ████ ████ (██████ ██████'s), father isn't released from the American prison, but these aren't just ordinary boys that are taken hostage, most of these kids are the sons of very powerful people in America and half of them were expelled from other schools before they came to █████ ██████'s. They're mouths and actions just may get them killed. When the government is desperately trying to figure out a way to help, █████, ████, ██████ and some more boys decide to take matters into their own hands.
