I love this film. ███████ ████'s portrayal as Bhalla a.k.a. "Shut up, ██████!" was so hilarious. Whenever he got hit during a fight scene, you could hear him squeal. ████ Khote is the dumbfounded ██████ a.k.a. "Rabbit". I love that ██████ ██████ a.k.a. "Crime ██████ ████". ██████ █████'s double role is so awesomely hilarious for his portrayal as ████████ █████ & ██████████ █████. ███████ Tandon and ████████ ██████ are out of this world. My brother does a really good mimicry of Bhalla saying. "Relax. PLEASE relax." I love the scene in which █████ ████ puts a laxative in Salman "███████" ████'s food which caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet umpteen number of times.
