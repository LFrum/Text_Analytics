Captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains. The movie follows the plight of █████ █████████ and ███ ████ as they struggle for the elusive ███████ ████ spot. █████████ led by his desire for the coveted time slot and ████ led by his agent and little-devil-on-the-shoulder, █████ Kushnick.<br /><br />█████ █████ (Kushnick) is excellent in this movie, alienating herself from such top dogs as ███ ██████, ██████ ███████████, and ██████ ████████. Towards the end of the film you are so entranced with how she handles every situation from guest bookings to delayed taping, that you find yourself wanting more.<br /><br />████ ███████ ███████ (█████████) plays his part to the tee. At times I found myself wondering if he was any relation to the real █████████.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiations.
