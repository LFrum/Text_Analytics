I think that the movie was really good. Subject, acting and ██████ █████ ALi ████'s music were marvellous. Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected ███████'s character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.
