From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator ████ ████, demonstrating why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so fierce) the direction of the film is nebulous: are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the New York streets to uncivilized peoples, or is this a message film of a more serious intent? But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear. ███████ █████'s direction of ████ ██████████'s adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created.<br /><br />Our narrator ████ ████ (█████ ███████) lives with his coke-addicted masseuse/sexually obsessed mother ███ (█████ ████) in New York, waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to South America (a father he knows only from letters and videos), when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives: one of ███'s wealthy clients █████ ███████ (██████ ██████████) rescues the down and out family and moves them to his ten acre estate, the epitome of wealth and power. In exchange for being ███████'s private masseuse, ███ and ████ can live in the mansion with the 'filthy rich' ███████s - daughter Mrs. Langley (█████████ ███████) and grandchildren Bryce (█████ █████) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). ███████ and his physician lead ███ on the drying out path and ████ bonds with ███████ and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity in poor versus wealthy, the living situation works - for a while. Incidents occur to alter feelings and ████ is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, a turning point for the film and ████'s view of the ███████ family. ███████ reveals his past to ████ and together they manage to discover the truth about ████'s troubling incident - and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy class.<br /><br />The film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer that works well, but when the director elects to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the context of the ███████ estate, the concept feel contrived, as though the audience has to be forced to 'get it'. The various subplots between maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and ████ and the introduction of an obese retarded chalk artist Whitney (███████ ████████) push the credibility edge of emphasizing the line between the wealthy and the 'lower class', but the performances by Sutherland, ████, and ███████ are strong enough to make us forgive the film's lapses. Not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas splashed around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction. █████ ████
