The title of my summary pretty much covers my review. <br /><br />This is to me what ███████ ██████ █████ ███████ was to someone 5 years older. While I missed out on that little pop-culture wave, I embraced the toy line and t.v. series that was ██████ ███ with both arms.<br /><br />You wanna know how into this I was? I went as ██████ ███ for Halloween.<br /><br />Thank God for the internet. Thanks to Demonoid, last week I was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade.<br /><br />I'm watching this right now, having just been blown away by recognizing ███ ███████ of Animaniacs, and am also loving the celebrity humor in "███ ████". 4 minutes in, and they have already mentioned, By NAME: █████ ████████, Governor Arnold, ██████ ███████, ████ █████, AND Ace Ventura. Hells yeah. <br /><br />Damn, it is only upon writing this that I realize there is NO WAY IN HELL I can give this series anything less than a perfect score. Any imperfections have been lost in the fog of time. <br /><br />This Is My Childhood. This Is Awesomeness. This Is The Mighty One.
