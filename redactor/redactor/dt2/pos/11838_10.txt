This 1931 comedy gets better with every viewing because of the comedic talents of ██████ ██████ and a terrific performance by C. ██████ █████. █████ plays a gruff old man who gathers his grown children (from his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. One is American (██████), one English (Ray Milland who looks about 18), and one Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises as the plot moves along with █████ ██████(was has no appeal at all) falling for ██████.<br /><br />██████ and █████ are just wonderful together and very touching. ██████ also gets to do a few dances and make a few "big" entrances. And of course ██████ is just gorgeous.<br /><br />Halliwell Hobbes, █████ █████, █████████ ██████, █████ ████████, █████ ██████, and █████ ████████ co-star. Had they given out supporting Oscar awards in 1931, █████ might well have been nominated. He's just excellent in this this gem.
