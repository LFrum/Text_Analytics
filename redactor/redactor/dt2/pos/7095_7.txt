What impressed me the most about "One True Thing" was how up-front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie. As depressing the subject matter was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2/3 into the movie ("████ █████" "Terms of Endearment", etc.). <br /><br />█████ ██████, █████ █████████ and ███████ ████ give very strong performances that don't go over the edge. The characters they play seem human; they're not perfect people. (Arguably, one might not say that about the "██████ ███████"-type character ██████ plays but throughout the film, I found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. She's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) <br /><br />"One True Thing" is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned.
