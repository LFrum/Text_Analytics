Having been a Marine, I can tell you that the D.I. is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting ██████ ████ boot camp and how boys are turned into men. ████ Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough, but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina. The film centers on one recruit who doesn't seem to "get with the program." A more recent film, ████ █████ ██████, also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing.
