I particularly enjoyed █████'s review of this film and agree that ██████ is not the only "damaged" character. ██████ is rather ruthlessly "set-up" by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or, if she is, that he murdered her. ██████ doesn't know and neither do we. In terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there, he bolts. However, he never actually harms █████ ██████, no matter how enraged he is. Indeed, he reacts with horror at █████'s fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors...then he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered █████ with the almost pathetic " I'm very tired now. I think I'll go home". Frankly, I don't think he's a psychopath. A sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath.<br /><br />The problem with ██████ is that he has no real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental condition denies him a place in the army. He is singularly rootless and isolated: no wife, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). And, he does a woman's job - "█████'s are my speciality". █████'s niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job. Also, although he finds himself strongly attracted to █████, he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. He is remarkably powerless - can't fight, can't work, can't make love.<br /><br />█████ is justifiably terrified, however. She tries to connect to him but, finding that he doesn't respond normally (i.e. way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose-tinted memories of husband ███), unwittingly presses all ██████'s buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape.<br /><br />Both characters, trapped in the house, trapped by fear, neuroses, rage and memory, deserve sympathy. I know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers, but I felt it fitted well, as it offered a kind of release to the characters. █████ is freed, I think, from the past. When ██████ tries on her husband's army coat, █████'s disgusted reaction is highlighted. She no doubt feels that the "sacredness" of ███'s possessions has been violated but, hopefully, her need to keep everything "untouched" has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. Perhaps she can move on.<br /><br />██████ is also freed - from his endless cycle of anger, hurt and violence. Whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable, but I hope it's the former.<br /><br />Great performances from Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On █████████ ██████", but this is pretty good too.
