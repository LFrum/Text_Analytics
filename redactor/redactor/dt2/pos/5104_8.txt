Yes 1939/Robert Donat-Greer ██████ version was the best...Perfection..Donat won the █████ in a very tough year..Gable in GWTW & █████ ███████ as ███ █████. were 2 of his competitors. .wow was that a rough year.. Most critics in NY hated this version. so.didnt see in theatre! Finally saw this A.M. on TCM & enjoyed..Peter O'Toole was excellent & glad he was █████ nominated for this,,& esp pleased █████ finally gave him a special award this past year... ██████ █████ was good as Mrs. Chips but her character,i feel was poorly written...Some good songs esp. You & I... sung by Ms.Clark & later recorded by many others including T.Bennett/S. Bassey & ██████ ██████.... the b&w version was more authentic.. but this is a good film beautifully photographed in color & panavision... enjoyable worth seeing & █████, again, ██ █ O'Toole!
