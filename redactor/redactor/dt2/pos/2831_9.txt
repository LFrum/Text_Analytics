"Only the Valiant" qualifies as a gritty good western. This Gregory ████ cavalry versus the Indians oater is a solemn suicide mission without a trace of humor. Veteran director ██████ ███████ has helmed a grim, harrowing outdoors epic with an ideal cast of tough guys under considerable pressure; even ███ ██████, Jr., registers superbly as a powerful ████ trooper. Ostensibly, "████████ █████████" scenarist ██████ ██ █████ & "A Place in the Sun" scribe █████ █████ drew their screenplay from western film maker ███████ ███████ ██████'s taut novel about a group of die-hard cavalrymen cut off from any escape route who must prevent murderous redskins from launching a devastating raid against helpless white settlers. North and █████ stick to ██████'s novel for the most part and the last minute revelation--when it seems that there is no way that our heroes can survive another onslaught of Native Americansis a corker! This turn-of-the-century tale develops an effective claustrophobic feeling in the second half of the action. Douglas and company take studio bound sets and make them look convincing during the nocturnal hours. The crisp black & white photography of "Going My Way" cinematographer ██████ ██████ imbues this western a grim look that accentuates its tension and atmosphere. █████ ███████ ██████, who later played the chief villain in "Guns of the Magnificent Seven," is extremely effective in a small role as the hated Indian leader ██████.<br /><br />"Only the Valiant" opens with over-voice narration by Army Scout ███ ███████. "This is my stamping ground. I'm a scout for the Army. Had my work cut out for me for a long time. Behind that pass there is the whole 'Pache nation. (There is a graphic of the territory with the Flinthead Mountains stretching across the screen with a bottleneck pass.) They used to come swarming out of the pass killing everything in sights. Then we built a fortFort Invincible. It plugged up the pass, just like a cork in a bottle. Things was fine for a while. But them 'Paches is pretty smart. One day the bottle blew the cork plum apart." We are shown the burning remains of Fort Invincible with a dead man pinned to a stockade wall and a lance sticking out of his belly. Captain ███████ █████ (Gregory ████ of "12 O'Clock High") and his men boil in on horseback and capture ██████ (███████ ██████), and ███ ███████ (████ █████ of "████ ████") wants to shoot him on the spot. ███████ points out ██████ is "the fella that started this whole business." ███████ █████ intervenes, "The Army doesn't shoot prisoners, ███." Predictably, ███████ is aghast at this prospect. "He's no common injun. He's just as near to a god as a fella can get. If you shoot him now, things will quiet down. Without ██████ stirring them up, the rest of those Indians will get reasonable, just as fast as they can. You take him in alive, you'll have every 'Pache in the territory coming after him. We have had three years of this, you can stop it now." Just as predictably, ███████ █████ refuses to kill ██████ and █████'s decision to take the Indian back sets things into action.<br /><br />Colonel ████ (███████ █████ of "█████ ███████") surprises █████ when he tells him he should have shot ██████. As it is, they need to get ██████ to another post. Everybody from the troopers to ███ ███████ knows that taking ██████ to Fort Grant is asking to die. The Apaches are poised in the mountains and the fort is under strength. Meantime, we are introduced to the daughter of Captain Eversham, █████ ████████ (███████ ██████ of "████ ████████ ███████"), and young Lieutenant ███████ ████████ (Gig Young of "They Shoot ██████, Don't They?") and they play a part in a major narrative complication. You see, █████ and ████████ both want to marry █████. Clearly, █████ wants █████. Colonel ████ refuses to let █████ take ██████ to Fort Grant because ████ cannot spare █████. ████ changes the orders and ████████ is given the mission at the last minute, and everybody is shocked. █████ has never changed an order. Furthermore, █████ saw █████ and ████████ kissing in public, and everybody thinks █████ has reassigned ████████ out of jealousy. Indeed, one officer observes that rewriting orders is about a possible as rewriting the Bible. Predictably, ██████ escapes and the surviving troopers and ███████ bring back a dead ████████.<br /><br />Although ████ expects a relief column of 400 troopers to arrive any day, ███████ points out to █████ that ██████ will attack. ██████ has seen the fort and knows their lack of strength. █████ requests to take 6 or 7 men of his choosing to man Fort Invincible and prevent ██████ from assembling a war party. The bottleneck in the mountains keeps the Indians from riding through in strength; instead, they must come through one-at-a-time. █████ believes his men can thwart them until the relief column arrives. ████ gives him permission and █████ picks the worst men. All of them hate him and would willingly kill him.<br /><br />"Only the Valiant" exemplifies the new breed of military western after World War II. This is not a gung-ho ████ ████ cavalry western. Indeed, █████'s own men want to kill him and this foreshadows the attitude of troops during the Vietnam War when they fragged their own officers. █████ bears the onus of allexcept the few who know about the circumstances that brought about the change of orders putting ████████ in charge of the detail. The black & white photography enhances the dire nature of this western. "Only the Valiant" amounts to a last stand western until the last minute reprieve. Reportedly, ████ hated this movie, but then this is not a spit-and-polish western in Technicolor. If anything, "Only the Valiant" lives up to its Warner Brothers origins. It is small but significant and it is grubby with loads of drama and unsavory characters, virtually a "█████ █████" western.
