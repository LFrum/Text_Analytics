If you don't like ███ ██████, you won't like this film. That's a given. Why anyone wouldn't like his films is unknown to me, but for those who can't see the light, just avoid it.<br /><br />Everyone else: This is a classic. The entire cast is perfect: █████ █████ is a dashing, clever, BRITISH Robin Hood, ███ ███████ overacts appropriately as ██████, ███████ █████ is his usual distracted, annoyed self, █████ ████ is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence as "Mervyn" the Sheriff of Rottingham, and ████ ████████, ████ █████ ██████, ████ ██████████, and the sadly underused ███████ ███████ are the perfect █████ Men.<br /><br />There are similarities to Spaceballs, ███████ ███████...and every other ███ ██████ movie. But why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well? The pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again...from the view of a 16 year old, at least. It's complete and utter parody, every second a play for a laugh. Some of them don't work, but most do, and well. I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched the film!<br /><br />Of course, if being barraged by constant visual and verbal gags isn't your style, you wouldn't like this. This isn't an ███████ █████ winner, it's ███ ██████. You know what it is when you're getting into it. If you want nonstop laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters, and catchphrases to last a lifetime, watch this.
