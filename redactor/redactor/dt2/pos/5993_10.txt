One of the two Best Films of the year. A well filmed, well written, well put together film with an outstanding cast. ███ Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, ███████ ████ ████ ███, ███████ ██ ████ ██, ██████ ████ ███ ████, ██████ ███ ███) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances. Theresa ███ plays her comedic role well (Though much like a female version of ███████ ████, her gag seems to be the foreign born Chinese surrounded by native HKers.), and I found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes, something I haven't done since 1. the fan boys took over alt.asian-movies and 2. ████ woo's Hardboiled. Sure the ending was expected, but I feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members. Highly enjoyable.
