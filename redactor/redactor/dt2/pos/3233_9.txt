I have read all of ████ ██████'s novels right the way through once a year every year since I was 9 years old and received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present. <br /><br />I loved this movie for its romance and for the music, which stayed, hauntingly, in my head. It was an interpretation of course, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something quite different and something █████████ herself would have loved. And oh to be loved by this passionate █████! This was the █████ of █████████'s imagination, and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels, and which was promised to us by the practical ████ ██████ who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely █████████ will indeed be one. I wonder if ████ was being entirely satirical in her novel. Perhaps, she too, could imagine such a █████. <br /><br />I haven't seen the film in many years, at least a decade. But, I have been yearning for it ever since.
