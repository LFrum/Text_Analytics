I was able to see "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free sneak preview. I absolutely LOVED the film! I was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother/daughter relationship...there was definitely a connection between █████ a and ███. I think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both █████ ████████ and ███████ ███████. ████████ was just the right actress to portray █████ and after leaving the theater I could not think of another actress in the role. ███████ was also excellent as ███. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I don't think any other teenage actress could. I think it would the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both ████████ and ███████ for Awards in the "Actress" and "Supporting Actress" categories. It would be a shame if they were overlooked.
