Director ████ ███████████'s tense and frantic film tells the true story of ███████████ █████ and ██████ ███████ ███, two young men who sold United States government secrets to the Soviet Union in the early 1970's.<br /><br />███████ ██████ plays ███████████ █████ very competently. He is a young man very disillusioned by the CIA's underhanded activities in allied Australia. Sean Penn, as the doped-up, drug running ██████ ███████ ███, is outstanding.<br /><br />The competent and professional direction of Schlesinger, along with some very good acting, make "The Falcon and the Snowman" an espionage thriller not to be missed.<br /><br />Tuesday, February 4, 1992 - █████
