███ ████ (Jean ████ ████████) discovers he needs to take some time off as everybody around him relies to much on him and stages his own death. When he discovers those he loved ans still loves are in need, he gets ██████ ████████ (███████ ████████) to help them. In search of his own past, of his own desires, this fabulous film by ██████ ███████ is a man's quest for himself at a ripe age.<br /><br />Built like all Lelouch films, the film's beginning with constant flashbacks may be puzzling, especially scenes where ████ ████████ (who looks a huge lot like his father) is playing a young ███ ████ while ███ ████ stands in the same room - a flashback sequence which takes a second to grasp.<br /><br />One of Lelouch's most elaborate works, L'itineraire d'un infant gate is a must-see tale of self fulfilment.
