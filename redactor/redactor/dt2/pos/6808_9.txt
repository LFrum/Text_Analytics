A sentimental, heart-tugging family film set in England of the 1920s. A young █████████ ██████ wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the Grand National; fortunately, ex-jockey ██████ ██████ is around to give ███ some help. ████████ Clarence Brown displays some remarkable control with material that could've been excessively maudlin in someone else's hands. He and screenwriters █████ ███████ and Theodore Reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. True, there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but overall it's quite affecting, and gorgeously filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is quite thrilling, and like so many great classics, there's a marvelous, three-hankie fade-out at the end. ███ proves that she was a real trooper right from the start, and Rooney--who I usually find rather annoying--is surprisingly subdued and really very good. ██████ Crisp is terrif as ███'s gruff father and ██████ ████████ is a delight as her older, boy-crazy sister. Most of the acting kudos, however, belong to ████ ██████, who won a richly deserved Supporting Actress Oscar playing ███'s wise and caring mother.
