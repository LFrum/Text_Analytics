Working girl █████ (Sothern) is engaged to ████ (Kelly), who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage. After being stood up on her birthday, █████ goes on a double-date/blind date, where she meets department store heir ███ ████████ (Hamilton). She falls in love, but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress, rather than his wife. ████████ ████ rallies 'round to comfort her, and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement, pressured in part by ████'s support of her family after she loses her job. When ███ returns, however, convinced that he wants marriage after all, will █████ follow her heart or her conscience? <br /><br />This film was a lot better than I'd expected it to be. The character of ████ at first comes off as the sort of loud comic Irishman type that ████ ██████ played so often. But Kelly (and the script) infuse the character with real compassion and love, and ████ turns out to be the best person in the entire group. Viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless Hartwell! The tone of the film wavers, however, between light-hearted romance and a much darker side, especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at ████'s garage.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by the dependable ████ ███████ as █████'s mother, an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious ██████ ██████ as █████'s younger brother, and ███████ ████████ as █████'s ne'er-do-well father.
