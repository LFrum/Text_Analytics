███████ begin The movie focuses on three friends, ███antha (██████ ███████), █████ (████ █████), and ████ (█████ ████). The movie starts out with ███ and ████ as the drug addicts, and █████, the track star, as the one who takes care of them. As things get increasingly worse at home for █████, he asks ███ what the drug is like. ███ is out of rehab and sober by this point and tells him it makes everything better. █████ then catches up with ████ and they start using. It takes chris two times till he is a " full time member". After some trouble with a dealer and a confession to ███, she gets in again. So begins the downward spiral for them. █████ od's when he breaks a promise to ███ (I want some of the movie to be a surprise). He dies, ███ gets in to college to be an Architect, and ████ gets arrested. so ends the story<br /><br />███████ ends. minor spoilers throughout<br /><br />Nick stahl is amazing. He will have an Oscar one day. His portrayal of █████ was Heartbreaking. He was the only one that felt real in the movie as far as drug use goes. █████ ████ who played ████ acted as if he were on speed not heroin. ██████ ███████ was fine, she is talented but what can i say ████ █████ stole the movie. His drugged eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /><br />The writers needed to show withdrawls in the movie. That is a main reason why people don't want to quit. Other then that there are hilarious scenes (the mall scene, and the Backstreet boy scene,man █████ nailed the reactions right on the head.), Touching, sad scenes (Like the scene between ███ and █████ in her bedroom after he gets beat up, i bawled, and the park scene.). It was realistic too. Like S am using again when █████ wanted to flush the drug down the toilet, and █████ using again after he goes to ███'s, even though he had been clean for two weeks, the pull was too strong. it is all realistic. <br /><br />Watch the movie for a great cast, great music, and a semi- truthful account of drug addiction.
