I say remember where and when you saw this show because I believe if ███ gives ████ ████ a chance █████ will be right up there with █████ in a few years because like █████ he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor.<br /><br />The funniest bits █████ has had so far are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners and if your not high and get CFS what does that say about you. <br /><br />In summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than SNL in an hour so lets hope ████ ████ gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour, more money and a band.
