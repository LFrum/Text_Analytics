███ ██████ gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great █████ ████. His handling of the character is very true to life and captures the flavor of Dean's background and limited education. The film of course centers around █████ █████ rise to fame and his sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he chose to ignore, much to his regret. His wife is splendidly portrayed by ██████ ███ who gives a very down to earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the ballplayer who rose to a "dizzying height" so quickly. The portrayal of █████'s later career as a sportscaster is honest and unflinching, reflecting his troubles which stemmed from his poor education and his colorful language both on and off the air. █████ was quite a character and █████ has breathed life into his story with admirable skill. If you enjoyed this film, I recommend the comedy "Kid from ████ █████" (1953) wherein █████ plays a down and out has-been ballplayer idolized by his young son (█████ ██████). █████ again fleshes out a ballplayer in a completely satisfying manner. I heartily recommend Pride of St. Louis to baseball fans everywhere.
