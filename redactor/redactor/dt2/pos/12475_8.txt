Ruthless mercenary █████ ██████ (████ ██████ in peak nasty form) betrays his pregnant partner/girlfriend █████ (well played by ████ █████████) in order to have exclusive dibs on a fortune in stolen diamonds. But █████ manages to seriously wound █████ before he gets away. █████ winds up in the swanky chalet of kindly rich doctor ███ █████ (a fine performance by ███████ █████). He also attracts the attention of █████'s two hottie daughters: the fiery ██████ (luscious ██████ ███████) and the sweet Alicia (nicely essayed by the lovely ███████ █████████). However, █████ soon realizes that something is very amiss about the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as he can. Meanwhile, the bitter █████ tries to find █████ so she can exact her revenge on him. Naschy, who wrote and directed as well as stars, concocts one of his strangest, most twisted and perverse horror vehicles ever with this little seen oddity. The offbeat plot and mysterious atmosphere become more weird and unnerving as the story unfolds, eventually leading to a genuinely startling surprise downbeat ending. This film further benefits from occasional moments of graphic gore (watch out for the memorable sequence with one poor guy being devoured alive by vicious flesh-eating pigs!), █████████ █████'s slick cinematography, and a decent sprinkling of nudity and soft-core sex. Good supporting turns by ██████ █████ as sassy maid ██████, ████ ████ as amorous playboy ███ ███████, and █████ ████ as the deranged Teresa. A pleasingly grim and worthwhile shocker.
