Its a good film set in Vienna about a cab driver, ████ (██████ ████), who steals a passenger's identity when the passenger is shot whilst sitting in the back of his cab. This gives him an identity as he is an illegal immigrant, but he needs to play out the role of the victim until he catches a flight to the U.S. with a ticket in the victim's name. ███ ███████ (Joan Camden) rumbles him but she is accused of having mental problems by her husband, Claude (███████ ███████), a concert pianist. As a result, ████ is let off the hook. Claude does not want to part from his wife, but she runs away from him. There are several plot twists and eventually both ████ and ███ ███████ make a run for it together - they are both trying to escape from their lives in Vienna. There is a tense, exciting build-up to the finale. Are they going to get away.....??...<br /><br />Unfortunately, the picture quality isn't fantastic and there is a line that runs down the middle of the picture for a while. The cast are all very good in their roles, especially ███████ ███████'s portrayal of Claude. Also important to the story are Heinth (███████ █████) as the cab company owner, Marie (Inge Konradi) as ████'s hometown girlfriend and the inspector (███████ ███████). <br /><br />Its a good film.
