██████'s Machine finds ████ ████████ as a narcotics cop who after a failed buy and bust that wasn't his fault, but that got a few people killed in it, he finds himself demoted to the vice squad in Atlanta.<br /><br />The prestige is hardly as good as the narcotics beat, but it does have its fringe benefits. One night after a roundup of working girls where one of their books falls into their hands, the guys ask for surveillance on ██████ ████'s place. She's an expensive item, servicing both notorious mobster ████████ ███████ and law and order gubernatorial candidate ████ Holliman.<br /><br />Their surveillance however records a murder and the rest of the film is ██████ and his new colleagues from vice trying to solve this prestige case.<br /><br />Though it's a ████ ████████ film and those usually have some humor to them, the comedy is kept in check as the film turns as deadly serious as █████ █████. It was reported in fact that █████ ████████ was offered this film.<br /><br />Look for some good performances by fellow vice cops ██████ █████ and █████ █████ and by █████ █████ the coked up brother of ███████ who does the dirty work of the organization and loves his job.<br /><br />It's not a bad film, a mixture of █████ █████ and █████. Why █████? You'll have to see ██████'s Machine for that answer.
