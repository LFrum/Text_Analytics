This is the middle cartoon of the three (between ██████ ████ and ████! Rabbit, ████!) and is the weakest of the three, while still being quite funny. It simply depends on one gag for too much of the action. Still a good cartoon. I feel a definite sympathy for █████ in this one, which is rare for me. █████ is so clearly overmatched that it almost becomes painful to watch at times. Good cartoon in an excellent series. Recommended.
