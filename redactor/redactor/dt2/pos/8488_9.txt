A couple of days ago I saw the awesome "House of Sand and ███" and I was impressed with the amazing performance of ███ ████████ in the lead role. I decided to see "Ray", trying to understand how and why ███ ████████ did not win the Oscar of ████ ████ █████. After watching █████ ████ in the role of ███ ███████, I agree with the Academy: he really deserved to be awarded. I like ███ ███████, I was not his fan, but it is amazing the resemblance of █████ ████ with him. The film is completely supported by █████ ████, who participates of most of the shootings, and his movements on stage looks like as if he was a reincarnation of ███ ███████. With regard to the story, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very pleasant, with many beautiful songs and scenes showing mainly a junkie ███ ███████. My greatest surprise was to find that ███ ███████ was heroine addicted, and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Ray"
