Like ███████ █████, █████ never got the material he deserved. Whatever you know of him is probably wrong. Get past the accent and go see his stand-up. You'll be very surprised -- he's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen and I have seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from █████ █████ to █████ ██████ to █████ ████████ to █████ ████ -- ██████ █████ is definitely up there). He's known for being a comic's comic. Even ██████ █████ said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever.<br /><br />The accussation that █████ is no ███████████ is ridiculous. ███████████ is known for having been a huge █████ fan. ███████████'s career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following █████'s shows. That is when █████ provided ███████████ with inspiration for his, "get no respect" routine. While I think ███████████ is great, see them both do stand-up and you'll see █████ is the better comedian.
