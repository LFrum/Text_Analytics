In the 70's in Afghanistan, the Pushtun boy ████ (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and the Hazara boy Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), who is his loyal friend and son of their Hazara servant ███ (Nabi Tanha), are raised together in ████'s father house, playing and kitting on the streets of a peaceful Kabul. ████ feels that his wise and good father ████ (Homayoun Ershadi) blames him for the death of his mother in the delivery, and also that his father loves and prefers ██████ to him. In return, ████ feels a great respect for his father's best friend █████ ████ (█████ ████), who supports his intention to become a writer. After ████ winning a competition of kitting, ██████ runs to bring a kite to ████, but he is beaten and raped by the brutal Assef (█████ █████) in an empty street to protect ████'s kite; the coward ████ witness the assault but does not help the loyal ██████. On the day after his birthday party, ████ hides his new watch in ██████'s bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to fire ███, releasing his conscience from recalling his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan and ████ and ████ escape to Pakistan. In 1988, they have a simple life in Fremont, California, when ████ graduates in a public college for the pride and joy of ████. Later ████ meets his countrywoman Soraya (██████ █████) and they get married. In 2000, after the death of ████, ████ is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the terminal █████ ████, who discloses secrets about his family, forcing ████ to return to Peshawar, in Pakistan, in a journey of redemption.<br /><br />I am not familiar with the Afghan culture and I did not read this novel in spite of the recommendation of my daughter, and yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief insight in the recent history of Afghanistan, from a peaceful period in the 70's to the present days with the Taliban. The actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. The arid locations in China recall the images we see in television from Afghanistan. In the end, I found "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Caçador de Pipa" ("The Kite Chaser")
