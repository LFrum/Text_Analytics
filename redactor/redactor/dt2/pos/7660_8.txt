████████' son gets severely wounded during a lion hunt that goes awry. ████████ (a solid and engaging performance by the beefy ███ ████) has to venture into an eerie and dangerous alternate dimension ruled by the evil and vengeful ███ the Earth Goddess (a deliciously wicked portrayal by ███ ██████) and battle various monsters in order to save his son's soul. Meanwhile, ███'s equally nasty son ███████ (a perfectly hateful turn by ████████ ███████████) poses as ████████ and takes over an entire city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. ████████ ███████ ██████ relates the engrossing story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout. This film begins a little slow, but really starts cooking once ████████ enters the misty and perilous subterranean spirit world: Rousing highlights include ████████ grappling with a humanoid lizard beast, ████████ climbing a giant gnarled tree, and ████████ being attacked by a bunch of creepy rotting zombies. ██████ still, the bizarre spirit world just reeks of spooky atmosphere (gotta love that persistent thick swirling fog!). The strenuous rough'n'tumble mano-a-mano major physical confrontation between ████████ and ███████ likewise totally rocks. Of course, we also get a big mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption as well. ███████ ███████'s crisp widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressively expansive sense of scope. ███ █████████'s robust, rousing score has a nifty majestic sweep to it. Okay, so this flick is an obvious cheapo cute'n'paste job that uses copious footage from both "████████ in the Haunted World" and "████████ and the Captive Women," but it's still an extremely lively and entertaining romp all the same.
