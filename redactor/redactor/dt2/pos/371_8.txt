I knew the premise of this film, and obviously I can't miss a good sounding film, especially from "Master of Suspense" director ███ ██████ █████████. Basically tennis champ ███ ██████ (██████ ███████) meets eccentric stranger, █████ ███████ (██████ ██████) on a train travelling from Washington to New York. █████ talks about a perfect murder, ███ hates his wife, and █████ hates his father, so █████ "suggests" swapping murders. ███ obviously didn't take him seriously, until of course when ███'s wife ██████ █████ ██████ (█████ ██████ (or █████ ███████)) is found murdered in an amusement park. ███ of course is the chief suspect, and █████ keeps "bumping into him" reminding him of their "plan", and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead. This murder enquiry and █████'s stalking are threatening his tennis career, and his relationship with the daughter of Sen. Morton (North by Northwest's ███ ██ ███████), Anne (Ruth Roman). █████ realises that ███ won't do his murder, so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty, ███'s monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park. After his tennis game, ███ and Anne (who obviously found out the murder "plan") race to the amusement park to stop █████, and they have a fight on the speeding out-of-control carousel. Also starring ████████ █████████ (the director's daughter) as ███████ ██████, ██████ █████ as Mrs. ███████, ████████ ████ as ███ ███████, ██████ ███ ████ as Police Capt. Turley and ████ █████ as Prof. Collins, and █████████'s cameo is the Man boarding train carrying a double bass. Some interesting dialogue and character interactions, some good suspense moments, and of course the unforgettable carousel finale, a good classic film. It was nominated the Oscar for ████ ██████████████. ███ ██████ █████████ was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!
