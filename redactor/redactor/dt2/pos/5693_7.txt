While on vacation on Northern Australia, Gracie (█████ █████), her husband ████ (████ ████████) and her younger sister ███ (█████ ███████) decide to take the Blackwater Barry tour in the swamp for fishing. Their guide ███ (Ben Oxenbould) uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills ███. The three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them, they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location. However, in the muddy water, their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water.<br /><br />"█████ █████" is a tense, realistic and dramatic low-budget movie and in accordance with the warning in the beginning, based on a true event. The acting of the unknown █████ █████, █████ ███████ and ████ ████████ is top-notch, giving credibility to this simple but scary story. There are many similarities between this movie and "Prey", but in different environments. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "████ ████████" ("Deep Fear")
