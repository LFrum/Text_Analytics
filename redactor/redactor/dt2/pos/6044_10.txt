I went through boot camp at MCRD Parris Island in 1953 and this film is about as accurate a depiction of what boots went through in that era, even to burying that danged sand flea. Many of the "actors" in the film were active duty ███████. This film may be more entertaining to ███████ than others, but I feel the film itself is very well done, and ████ ████ made a "good DI". ██████ ██!
