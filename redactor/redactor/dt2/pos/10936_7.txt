There must have been some interesting conversations on the set of Eagle's Wing, with ██████ █████ straight off Apocalypse Now co-starred with the actor he replaced on ███████'s film, ██████ ██████. A real unloved child of a movie, dating back to the last major batch of Westerns in 1979-80, it was much reviled at the time for being made by a British studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classic American westerns were directed by European émigrés), which seems a bit of an over-reaction.<br /><br />The plot is simplicity itself, as ██████ █████'s inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with ███ █████████'s nonosyllabic Kiowa warrior over the possession of a beautiful white horse, the Eagle's Wing, across a harsh and primitive landscape in a time "before the legends began." Aside from ████████ █████████'s captive Irish governess, the supporting cast have little to do (████████ ██████ never even gets to open her mouth) and it is a little slow, but ███████ ██████'s film does boast terrific Scope photography from █████ ████████ and a good score from ████ █████████.
