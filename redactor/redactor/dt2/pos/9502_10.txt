█████ B. DeMille directed a series of domestic comedy-dramas in the late teens and early 20s. He found his perfect leading lady for these provocative pieces in ██████ ███████. In Don't Change Your Husband, ███████ plays a bored housewife whose wealthy businessman husband (███████ ██████) pays more attention to work than to her. She is chased by a handsome roue (███ ████) until she relents and divorces the boring husband for the new lover.<br /><br />Things soon become familiar and ███████ discovers the new husband is as neglectful as the first. To make matters worse she discovers ████ has a woman on the side (█████ ████). After several confrontations and convenient meetings, things are resolved.<br /><br />This was a smash hit in 1919 and helped make ██████ ███████ a major star. Although she was only 20 when she filmed this she is very good as the maybe foolish wife. She looks great and wears some stunning gowns.<br /><br />There is one memorable scene that is 100% DeMille in which ████ is luring ███████ with promises of wealth, pleasure, and love. As he coos to her she imagines the scenes. Pleasure is a fantastic scene of ███████ in a spidery hammock swinging out over a pool while people dance around. Wealth is a scene in which ███████ is gowned like a Babylonian queen as servants bring her chests of jewels, which shes tosses aside. Love is a scene in which she is a wood nymph making love in a forest glade with a Pan-like character (███ █████). Pure hokum but very entertaining, and ███████ looks great.<br /><br />Dexter is very good as the bland husband who shaves off his moustache and starts to work out in order to win his wife back. ████ is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. Faye is funny as the bitchy other woman--named ███████ no less--who gets hers. Sylvia ██████ plays Mrs. Huckney. ███ █████ was married to Ruth St. █████ and together they were groundbreaking and influential modern dancers (of the █████hawn School).<br /><br />███████ impresses me more every time I see her. She seems to have been such a natural actress and yet there is a way that the camera captures her expressive face that is just mesmerizing. She's a joy to watch.<br /><br />Very entertaining film with lots of color tints in varying scenes to keep things lively. And a lot of the furnishings are back in style 86 years later.
