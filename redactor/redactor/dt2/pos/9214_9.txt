I must admit that I am a fan of cheesy '80's cartoons, but this is among the best. ███████ █████ and the Star Stealer is one of the most watchable and entertaining of the ███████ █████ cartoons, and is much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between ███████ and Darian and find it very amusing. My favorite character, though, is Starlite who is definitely the most "magnificent horse in the universe"!<br /><br />I also recommend ███████ █████: New Beginnings, which tells the story of how ███████land came to be. Have a ███████-Day!
