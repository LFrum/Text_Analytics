A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by ███ ██████ & Co, have been made, but "The Muppet Movie" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features "The Great Muppet Caper" and "The Muppets Take Manhattan". It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after ██████'s premature death in 1990. I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack. Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day, while ██████ the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing "███████ ██████████", a Hollywood agent named ██████ comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. ██████ takes his advice and goes west. He soon meets ██████ ████, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along. The frog is also noticed by ███ ██████, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants ██████ to be his mascot. As a frog, ██████ is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with ██████. On their road trip across the country, ██████ and ██████ meet other Muppets who join them, including ████ █████ (who soon becomes ██████'s love interest) and █████. Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, ███ ██████, assisted by ███, is willing to do anything to force ██████ to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so ██████ finds himself in increasing danger! <br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated "███████ ██████████" at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as ██████ and ██████'s catchy road song, "█████' █████ █████", and "I'm Going to Go Back There Someday", a poignant ballad sung by █████. "Never Before, Never Again", the song ████ █████ sings when she first sees ██████, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden. The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including ██████, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as ███ ███████ as ██████ the Agent and █████ ██████ as the "Insolent Waiter." Also, it's not 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing "Muppets from Space" (one of the Muppet movies made after ██████'s death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters! Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it! However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier. "The Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable. I highly doubt there's much left to say about "The Muppet Movie" that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment.
