Always enjoyed "DOA",1950,which starred ██████ ███████ and was very curious about this film. ██████ █████,(██████ ███████), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. ██████ gets involved with ███ ████(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. ██████ learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems! If you like ██████ █████ and love ███ ████ you will enjoy viewing this film, ███ gave an outstanding performance and kept this picture worth watching!
