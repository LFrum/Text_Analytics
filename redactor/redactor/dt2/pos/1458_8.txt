We have moved far beyond this tentative foray into a forbidden area-drug addiction-for the 1950s. As such, the film may seem dated. The Man with the Golden Arm served its function is peeling back a layer of the underside of society, an eye-opener to a Southern country boy in 1955 when I first viewed this film in the theater. After some serious consideration about being too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and affecting then and still maintains some sharp, painful moments of the soul stripped naked. As a movie depicting the loneliness at the core of being, it succeeds.<br /><br />Filled with angst, █████ ███████, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. He conveys his helplessness and ineffectualness in a beautifully restrained performance. As a voice of common sense in the dead-end urban jungle, ███ █████ as █████ is quite good. She is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and █████ is really good. ██████ McGavin plays a slimy character and does it very well. ███████ Parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role of the pathetic Zosch, the crippled wife of Sinatra. Arnold █████ is another unlikely survivor of the street. Regarded as pitiful and despicable, his character ███████ provides tart comedic moments. <br /><br />The music is almost the star of this film-brooding, frenetic, moody, poignant. █████ █████████'s score perfectly accentuates the tensions of ███████ ███████'s spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin. █████'s theme is bittersweet and captures aurally what the film depicts visually. I know of no other soundtrack that effectively complements the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as does this one.
