SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of ██ ████ and ██████. They have great chemistry. ██████ delivers the one-liners, ██ ████ cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of ██ ████ or ██████, you're going to enjoy this movie.
