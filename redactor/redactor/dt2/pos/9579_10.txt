How often do you see a film of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? █████'s Last Stand is a refreshment. Here █████ is selling lemonade but isn't making any money. ███████, Spanky, █████, ██████, and █████████ come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 Men In A Tub and Came The Brawn where there was competition between ███████ and █████ for █████'s affection. Back to the story: The Gang taste the lemonade to see if █████ made it right. One funny moment is when ███████ gets a glass cup for lemonade and █████ fills is and gives it to █████ and ███████ has an angry expression on his face. Spanky proposes a floor show to go with the lemonade and even ██████ agrees ever so cute. When the floor show begins there is no one at the barn but then a customer comes in (██████). Spanky asks him if he wants lemonade but all he does is nod no. Spanky asks him numbers of time in the short and every time ██████ nods no Spanky displays many expressions on his face which is funny. Spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. One way is when after ██████ said ever so cutely "Those crackers are salty and they made me thirsty". There is also many entertain musical bit is this short. The opening number is by █████ which she tap dances and sings. The second includes ███████ singing off-key (as usually) with ██████, ███████, Spanky, and █████████ about "How dry I am!" (I believe they sing that to make ██████ thirsty. It also made me laugh.). The closing number includes boys and girls all dressed up in an old fashion way. This was █████'s last Our Gang short. A grand musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10.
