After clocking up five seasons on the small screen from 1976-79, '██████ & ███████' transferred themselves to the big screen in mid 1980. Instead of ███████ ████████ and █████ █████ retaining their roles as writers, ████ ████████ was brought on board as the writer. Sadly, this film adaption just did not seem to hit the spot with the public. Shame. I liked it, better than the series itself in fact. It was a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />'███████ █████' (██████ █████) is keen to ascertain whether or not her slovenly husband '██████' (█████ ██████) has remembered their wedding anniversary. Obviously, he hasn't, but to try and convince his wife otherwise he books a table at the restaurant where he proposed marriage to ███████ several years ago.<br /><br />Upon arriving at the restaurant, they find out that the place has changed hands. Eventually seeing through ██████'s lies, ███████ insists that they celebrate their anniversary at a swanky hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, ██████ is mistaken by crook 'Harry █████' (█████████ █████) for a ruthless hit-man, who wants a rival to be exterminated!<br /><br />Not an outstanding comedy as such but a good natured piece of fun all the same. Plans to revive the series after the film's showing were sadly terminated when ██████ █████ died on 24th August 1980 of alcohol poisoning.<br /><br />Funniest moment- ██████ talking to his favourite garden gnome. His neighbour, ████████ creeps up behind him and says ''I think its time we had a chat''. ██████, thinking it has developed the power of speech, drops the gnome in shock!<br /><br />█████ █████████ to fellow IMDb users, in particular 'AdamFontaine', 'Cyril █████' and 'TheLittleSongBird'. Have a good one!
