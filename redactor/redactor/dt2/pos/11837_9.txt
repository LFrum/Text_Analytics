toplines this ok comedy about an aging father (C. ██████ █████) who decides to gather his grown children from around the world. ██████ is working as a chorus girl in New York when she gets the news that "daddy" wants her. Hmmmm, sounds familiar. ██████' considerable talents as a comedienne save this otherwise so-so comedy as she upsets the staid British countryside with her brazen American personality. Not as sharp as some other ██████ comedies, but still worth a look. ███ Milland plays her long-lost "brother." █████ Lloyd, █████████ ██████, and Halliwell Hobbes are all fun, too.
