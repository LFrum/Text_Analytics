I suppose I like this film as well as any I know; it is not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special █████ ███████'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative. The improbably but delightful story-line follows ████ █████, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; ████ ███████ passing as █████ is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too, for Germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic. ████'s target is ███████ ████████, a charismatic U.S. squadron leader who can supply her valuable information. The plot thickens comes when ████ falls in love with ████████, has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy, and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes. She gets jealous of a rival for ████████'s affections, then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business. The logical end of the film comes when after the terrible WWI has ended, as she sings the theme song of the film, "Wishing" in a darkened theater, one by one the members of ████████'s squadron appear, including her lover himself, indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even █████ ████ enthusiastically joins in the singing of "It's a Long To Tipperraree", to indicate all is well with the world again. This is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea, written by director █████ ███████ and ███████ █████ ██████ of "████ ████████" fame; and it is a delightful narrative. ████████'s squadron, including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and realization. Credit must go to ████ ████ and ██████ ██████ for their costume creations, ███ █████ and ████ ███████ for sets, ████████ ███████ for another beautiful production design, █████ ███████ for his sensitive and appropriate musical score, and to Russell Harlan for his shining cinematography. In the beautiful footage, the principal actors are █████ ███████ as ████, ████ ██████ as ████████, ██████ ████ outstanding as ████'s █████ ████, ███████ ██████, █████ ████████ as the inebriate pilot, gorgeous Gloria Paul as ████'s stripteasing rival, and many other fine actors in smaller parts. It is hard to say enough nice things about the pace, or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by Edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare, to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization.. This comedy also helps prepare the way for ████'s conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing. This is a rare "sense-of-life" film about ████'s "Americanization", her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen. It is haunting, I find, and beautiful in many ways. I consider it to be █████ ███████'masterpiece of directing; and under the title "The Americanization of ████" I believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard I know.
