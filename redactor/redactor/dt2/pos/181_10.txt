While █████(███████ ███████)is off to fight in war against the Germans for his ██████ ██████, his beloved ████████(███████ █████████)marries his conniving cousin ████(█████████ ███████)in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over Moscow. Through various trials and betrayals, ████████ will await word or letter from █████ no matter how long it takes, holding hope that he will return to her.<br /><br />Powerful piece of film-making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer ██████ █████████. Some of the many magnificently framed, moving shots include the scene where the camera follows ████████ through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to █████..and doesn't quite reach him even as we watch █████ looking impatiently into the swarm without luck. The sequence after the air raid where ████████ walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where ████ makes his lustful move on ████████ as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of MANY examples where ██████ █████████ shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film. But, without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly, deeply love each other, this film couldn't hold up with the beauty of the visual alone. Together, however, we're left with an amazing film..simply a haunting masterpiece from the Soviet Union after ██████ breathed his last breath. I feel honored just have beheld such a great film.
