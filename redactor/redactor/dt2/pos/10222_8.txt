For a movie like this, there's always something to follow by in years to come. █████ ██████, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, part-Mythology, and all horror in-between. "Nightbreed" are a bunch of mutants who only come out at night, and roam the place called Midian. Now a man name █████(█████ ███████) claims to suffer hallucinations he goes to this shrink Dr. ██████(█████ █████████) who "helps" █████ with his problems. Unaware of this situation, ██████ claims to be a purist which he's only a hate-monger in disguise. █████ however, goes into Midian and make the claim that he's one of the mutants there. But a mutant named Peloquin(██████ ██████) sees █████ as meat! His bite however, spares █████ so after he is killed by a gauntlet of fire arms, he's one of them now. After being mislead by ██████, █████ does everything in his power to protect Lori(████ █████) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun, and in return helps the others as well. I liked the lady mutants one who gives a smoky "kiss of death" and the Porcupine Woman who dreamed █████ show off her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time. I've enjoyed this horror movie all the way, and the rule of it is, never trust a shrink! Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!
