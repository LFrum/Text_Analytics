It's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a Norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the American public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed. But █████ ██████ was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure Catholic college on the map.<br /><br />I've heard clips of ██████'s famous pep talks and it is uncanny how ███ ███████ got the voice and the inflection perfectly. In what turned out to be his career role, ███ ███████ captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was ██████. ██████ is assisted by well by ████ ████ as ██████ ██████ ██████ who complained about her home being a training camp for █████ ████, but never threw anyone out of her house.<br /><br />██████'s first impact on football was as a player with █████ ████ not a coach. One fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored Army, ██████ and team mate ███ ██████ played by ████ █████ used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. Before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense. ██████ didn't invent the forward pass, but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that. <br /><br />██████ knew how to work the media also. Those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players. They were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that ██████ ███ of Sports in the Roaring Twenties. <br /><br />Playing a small, but key role is ██████ ██████. As ██████ ████, the first player ██████ coached to achieve greatness, ██████ not only got a good performance, but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career. That deathbed scene which ██████ swore was accurate became a Republican battle cry as many a GOP underdog went out to win one for the Gipper.<br /><br />I still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering President ██████ ██████ at █████ ████'s graduation with his old friend ███ ███████. ██████ always credited O'Brien and ████ ██████ of all the ██████ Brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good.<br /><br />█████ ████ itself owes its prestige to ██████. It's quite possible that █████ ████ would be an obscure small Catholic College without the reputation that football brought to it.<br /><br />Though ██████ ████ and the later famous backfield of the Four Horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was ██████ who had the reputation. It's no accident that ██████ Brothers was able to get ████ ██████ █████, █████ 'Pop' ██████, ██████ █████, and ███████ █████████, ██████'s contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in █████ ██████, All American. It was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession.<br /><br />I think more than football fans will enjoy █████ ██████, All American. Though you might become one after seeing the film.
