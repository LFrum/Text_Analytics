1. I've seen ████████ ██████: ███████ is too old, speaks frequently with a high pitched voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor ! (see also much ado about nothing from ███████ - the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I've seen Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all of them 3. █████ ██████ ██████ is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! █████ ██████ is convincing - seems a bit of a lunatic - very suitable! and ██████ ███████ - wonderful, and ██████ █████ is a very attractive queen. You believe those actors what they are saying - I think this is the best compliment.
