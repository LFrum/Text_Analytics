The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made. ████ ███ █████ is my personal hero. Whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block, I can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, ████'s the man. Nobody is meaner. █████ Dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers take down ███ ███ and ██████ █████. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many one-liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of lines from Dolemite, you are instantly cool. If you are in the mood for a laugh riot, rent this movie. Also check out The Human Tornado, █████ █████████, and █████ ██████████ the Devil's Son-In-Law. Now, can you dig that? <br /><br />"You no business barring, insecure, rat soup-eating, motha!!'"
