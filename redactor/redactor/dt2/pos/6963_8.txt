The lovely, yet lethal Alexandra (stunning statuesque blonde beauty ██████ ███████, who looks absolutely smashing in a tight black leather outfit) must find a magic amulet so her evil demonic master Faust can cross over into our dimension. It's up to fearless, rugged cop ████████ ██████ (likable █████ ██████) to stop her. Meanwhile, two pitifully unfunny "comic relief" dwarf gnome creatures run amok in Los Angeles. Seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert ███ ████████ relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously. The cast struggle gamely with the silly material: the adorable ███████ ████ █████ as sassy, fetching police captain Kate, ██████ ██████ as tart, sexy hooker ███████, █████ ██ █████ as ██████' bumbling, excitable partner ██████, █████ ████████ as alluring museum curator ██████, and ███ ████ as the jolly Dr. Rochelle. ████ █████'s puerile cookie cutter script, an amusingly lowbrow sense of no-brainer humor, █████ ██████'s bouncy cornball score, the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber Halloween masks, J.E. Bash's plain cinematography, no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of, and the tacky (less than) special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid Velveeta. An entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck.
