Nice description of the situation in the US, it explains different kinds of █████, not just show terrorist and extremist. █████ can be other thing that killing, they show why some people become terrorist and how to be ██████ without being extremist. It is a great series that ███████ and no-███████ should see. Now we hope that other series or films will be done to change the idea of all ███████ are terrorist and all Americans want to destroy █████. It gave me the interest to discover what █████ is exactly and what the US and also European government do to help cohabitation between people of different religion.
