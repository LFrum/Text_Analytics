████████ - is the one Sci-Fi Show which restarted the Interest in Science Fiction in me.<br /><br />But ████████ is so much more then plain and simple Sci-Fi. Comedy, █████ and much more :) The Acting is very good. Luckily ████████ survived also it's cancellation and showed with ███████████ ████ that it is not dead yet :) I hope there is a future for ████████ :) In my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the Show are muppets. You have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty ████████ is.<br /><br />████████ set a new Standard in Television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than ████████. I love this Show :)<br /><br />SaphirJD
