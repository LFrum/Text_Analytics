In Strangers On A Train, it's obvious from the start that playboy wastrel ██████ ██████ has singled out ██████ ███████ as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders. ███████'s a semi-public figure, he's a tennis pro, but not an especially high one. High enough however for him to know that ███████ is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry ████ Roman.<br /><br />So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon, ██████ knows enough that ███████ will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them, complete strangers, did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise. Though ███████ is repulsed by the idea, one of the beautiful things about this film, is that you can see in the performance he gives that ███████ just might submit to temptation.<br /><br />In fact when ██████ kills █████ ██████, ███████'s wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man, he expects that ███████ will in turn murder ██████'s father so that ██████ can inherit his estate. Today ██████ would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that.<br /><br />Alfred █████████ directed ██████ to his career role, ironically in his last complete film. ██████ died the following year with most of My ███ ████ finished. █████████ does not do too bad by ██████ ███████ either. <br /><br />Of course when ███████ does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him, the tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing, first in the tennis match in which ███████ has to finish the match and waylay ██████ before he plants evidence convicting ███████ at the crime scene. And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between ██████ and ███████.<br /><br />Strangers On A Train is █████████ at his best, it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing.
