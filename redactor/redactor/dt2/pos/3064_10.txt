███ ██████ really outdid himself with this hilarious stand-up of the █████ ████ story. The cast is perfect, and ████ █████ does a fine job at his role. In my personal opinion (besides the fact that I'm a ████ █████ fan) this movie is the best, and funniest, I've ever seen! It will have you laughing every time you see it!
