So many times, █████████ has tried to remake Hollywood hits, only to produce total duds. Mercifully, ████ ██████'s interpretation of "Sleeping with the Enemy" is an extremely stylish and well-made films.<br /><br />████ ████ ████ is obsessed with ████ ██████ (who's looking her very best in here!). When he realizes that ████ has a fiance in Sunny Deol, he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his.<br /><br />Every frame of this film is a delight to watch. Whether it's ████ ████ chanting his trademark "I love you, K...k...k...kiran!" or the feel-good mushy scenes between Sunny and ████ (who make a perfect match), you won't feel like leaving your eat in boredom.<br /><br />Each and every song on the soundtrack is ear pleasing, especially █████ ████ █████ and ██ ████ █████. Like I said, ████ looks like a Goddess in this film. ████ may not be SRK's best film (that honor goes to Baazigar), but it definitely figures as one of his most flawless performances! Sunny is OK. He's done similar roles before, but he's good.<br /><br />Overall, ████ is g...g...g...great! ;)
