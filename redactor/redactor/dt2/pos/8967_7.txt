████ ███████' film "███████ ██████'s War", set in the 1980's, tells the story of how the title character (played by ███ █████) managed to wage a covert war with the Russkies by way of aiding the Afghan forces. Of course, we know how well that turned out in the long run but, thankfully, the film does not gloss over the unpleasant after-effects.<br /><br />The cast is star-studded, with ███ █████ and █████ ███████ being among the most bankable stars in Hollywood. As a bonus, you've got the versatile ██████ ███████ ███████ in a characteristically memorable supporting role, one for which he received a not unwarranted Oscar nomination. I'm not much of a fan of Roberts but █████ is always dependable. Nevertheless, I can't quite buy into him as a drug-using womanizer, although the real ███████ ██████ seems just as eminently likable as █████. Apart from the big three, though, there's not much worth remarking on, even from a recognizable name like ███ Adams.<br /><br />The story is engaging and is bolstered by a fine script from █████ ██████. The verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and is chock full of memorable lines. The later events set into motion by the war are not ignored though the bookending scenes honoring ██████ seem to me to be too earnest to achieve the bittersweet feel which was likely intended. On the whole, ███████' direction is workmanlike and follows the action of the script admirably.<br /><br />This is a film that, like ███████ ██████ himself, has flaws but is nevertheless disarmingly likable. Certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light-hearted feel.
