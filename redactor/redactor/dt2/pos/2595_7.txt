...And there were quite a few of these. <br /><br />I do not like this cartoon as much as many others, partly because it was made in its period. I much prefer cartoons with █████ and ████ which are fifteen or so years before-hand. Many people will like this, particularly people who always find violence funny, cartoon or not.<br /><br />The basic plot is a pretty well known one for ██████ █████: Elmer goes out hunting, █████ leads him to ████ and █████ ends up being shot instead. Also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes (some do not enhance the episode), ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre. The plot is mainly geared by jokes - each joke keeps the episode going. This way of plot-going is not all that unusual in ██████ █████ (of course if you are pretty much a ██████ █████ boffin - or an eager one - like me, then you'll know this already).<br /><br />For people who love everything about ██████ █████ and █████ ████ and like the sound of what I have said about it, enjoy "██████ █████████"!<br /><br />7 and a half out of ten.
