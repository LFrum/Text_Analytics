RKS after the success of GHAYAL started work on this film which was a comedy The film was in making for 3 years and released finally in 1994 but didn't work for some reason Before this film, DAMINI(93) released and did well <br /><br />The film is a mad comic film like most Priyadarshan films nowdays but it is funny and well handled The film has a proper plot unlike today's films and makes you laugh most characters became famous, be it Crime master gogo(██████ ██████), ██████ █████ and others<br /><br />The film keeps you laughing throughout it's run time though being too slapstick and overdone yet it's one of the funniest films<br /><br />Direction by RKS is very good █████ is good<br /><br />Amongst actors █████ steals the show and delivers his funniest performance, this was his first out n out comedy ██████ does well but looks amateur front of █████, yet does a good job and their chemistry is delightful ███████ is annoying and sounds like a child ███████ is adequate ██████ █████ is too funny in both roles, ██████ ██████ is hilarious in his over the top act ███████ ████(dubbed by ████) is very good and ████ █████ too is funny rest all are good too
