I love this film. Tense with great characters. The kid from "███████" is excellent as is █████ ███████. When the kids storm the bank, it is pure adrenaline. Inside of the bank, it becomes a bit like a "Lord of the Flies" situation where they turn on each other. ██████ Walker from "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw this on "Showtime" while channel surfing. It was a pleasant surprise. █████ Remar is also quite good here as the small town Sheriff. ██████ Nichols who I love from "█████████" does a nice job too as a Federal Agent. I recommend this film for any fan of bank robbery movies with a lot of good characters. I was shocked to discover that █████ ██████ was a producer on this, since the film is not a B movie.
