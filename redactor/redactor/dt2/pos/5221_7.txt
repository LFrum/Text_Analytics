██████ Hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling ██████ who is definitely a HOOD! ███████ ██████ plays ████ ███████ who is a hood always on the look-out for the one big "score" that is going to put him on easy street. His wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care. When he "got out" he thought they were probably better off in foster care  besides he still had to score his fortune. His daughter ████████ ███████ (played wonderfully by ███████ █████) breaks out of a foster care institution that is abusing the kids and misappropriating money that is suppose to be being spent on the kids. She hunts down her father; tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother, █████ ███████ (played by █████ ███████) , "just a little 7-year-old kid" was being moved to the institution that she had just broken out of and convinces her father to kidnap him. The three start off on an adventure across country, all the while ████ keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids! ███████ ██████ is really good in this comedy, playing a "hood" (probably a little understatement for this criminal character) who is similar to his ██████ ██████ character of █████ ███████ except ████ is appropriately funnier in this comedy and more optimistic than ██████ ██████. ██████ is funny and rally does comedy pretty well! █████ █████ plays ████████ ██████ who is a reporter trying to get at the truth of the foster care system who becomes ██████'s ally. █████ Ladd plays Rita the con-artist mother of ████ ███████.
