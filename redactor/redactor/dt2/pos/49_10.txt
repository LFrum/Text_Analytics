██████████ █████ is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports "it takes a village to raise a child" and reminds of an important time in black history and culture. I gained an incredible amount of respect for ████ ████ as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like ████'s character. S. ██████ █████████ is absolutely fantastic as █████. I never realized that ██████ was such a great actress. Law & █████ never showcased the depth of ██████'s acting abilities like ██████████ █████. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood...it was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane. I truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the DVD release to add to my collection.
