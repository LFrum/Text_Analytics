When █████████ debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. While I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), in no way was it boring. As █████ █████ said, `there has never been a movie like █████████.' I usually don't agree with █████, but for once he speaks the truth. Although ████ ██████' Sunshine State may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing that I have ever seen or known of can even compare to the striking originality of the Polish Brothers' █████████.<br /><br />█████████ is a perfect example of how many times it's better to trek an extra few minutes to go to an art-house film instead of the latest ████ █████ movie. The plot isn't some hackneyed, cookie-cutter plot; it's just so strikingly original. A small town in Montana named █████████ has a dam nearby that is about to be taken down. Therefore, the entire town must be evacuated. Some people, however, just don't want to leave. In a side plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very sick and bedridden; he's being taken care of by ██████ ██████ (████ █████). The boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who help him out through his time of sickness.<br /><br />Although much of the movie is straightforward, some of it could give █████ █████ a run for his money. There's odd weather patterns, a weird, wooden, huge dog thing, and symbolism that would make ███████ proud. It's not as overall confusing as a Lynch film, but it's still quite odd. That's what makes █████████ so great: it's so out of the ordinary and yet so simple and plausible.<br /><br />█████████ has a magical feel to it: it's almost like you're watching something you're not quite sure what it is but you feel entranced by it. As I said earlier, I agreed with █████ on how this movie is unlike any other. However, I disagree when he says that it is `not entertaining'. He goes on to say it's just `enthralling.' Perhaps he just thought he should give it good reviews because everyone else is, but in lieu of how slow it was, I still thought it was very entertaining, something many dramas now can't do.<br /><br />█████████ may not be the quickest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get to and through it, you'll be extremely surprised, as I was.<br /><br />My rating: 8/10<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for brief sexuality.
