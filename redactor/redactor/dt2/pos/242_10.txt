I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. ████ ████████ was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Although a musical, I thought ████ ████████ did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. As far as her dancing, I think she was excellent. Even █████ ██████ pretty much endorsed ████'s dancing in this film as she commented that ████ danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it, █████ ██████ was an excellent dancer. The cinematography and vivid colors are also noted. ████ wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by ████ █████. Does she leave █████ to fulfill her dream and bypass love and Broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? You'll have to watch the film to find out!
