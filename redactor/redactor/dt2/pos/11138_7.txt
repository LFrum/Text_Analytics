I was surprised to catch this on TV Friday, and I enjoyed it. Between the presence of ██████ ████████ and the numerous references to everything that could be considered "cyberpunk", this was a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed the story, which reminded me of a book I've read ("Earth", █████ ████), and was fun to see on TV. ██████ looks great, but I also enjoyed her performance as ███ because she did seem different from everyone else. But the greatest thing about this movie was the atmosphere that has been described in books by ██████, Sterling, and others. It was just fun to see it on TV.
