Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by ██████ █████████. If you like █████████'s `Rope', then you will like this movie. `██████ by Numbers' stars ██████ ███████ as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective ██████ ██████████. Her partner is ███ ███████, a non-discriminatory detective played by ███ ███████. <br /><br />The teenage killers are high school students ███████ ███████ (████ ███████) and ██████ █████████ (███████ ████). These young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers.<br /><br />The supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on. The movie reminds me of various `█████████' movies crossed with the TV show `Law and █████'. We see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't.<br /><br />The other plot in the movie relates to ██████ ██████████'s past and incarcerated ex-husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but I found this to the most intriguing part of the story.<br /><br />`██████ by Numbers' is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe, or should I say dangerous, murder mystery. For more thrills and suspense, try `Se7en' or █████████'s `████ █ for ██████'.
