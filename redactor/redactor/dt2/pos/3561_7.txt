A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker ███████, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit ████████. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when ████████ tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but ████████ is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of ████████) and offers to save his life for half of the gold. In exchange ████████ gives him half of the medallion, but ███████ notices it and discovers something is up. Soon all three are crossing each other for the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and ████████'s gang are watching on, waiting for their chance to pounce.<br /><br />Just watching the opening sequence you'll know you're in for a spaghetti western with a tongue-in-cheek style and a reliance of sprinkling many references (some nicely realised) from other films (largely the Dollar trilogy) of its sub-genre. ████████ ████ ██████████'s sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight, but there's potential in many of his grand, showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace. Largely there's a lot of tussles, fist-fights (and plenty of acrobatic stunts) taking place, compared with all-out vicious shootouts. However most of these stunts are very well done, and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there's energy to burn. The traditional story sticks close to conventional details, but since there's a lot of conniving and outfoxing going on, the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite certain how it's eventually going to play out between the three. This leads up to many effective suspenseful moments, clever twists, and plenty of wink, wink. The humour within the starch script is pretty sly. Worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style, is ████████ █████████'s dynamically taut framing and █████████ ██ ████'s impulsively rousing music score. The performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport. ██████ ██████'s wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger. ███████ Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit ████████. ███ ██████ gives a poised performance as ███████, that holds up well. ██████ O'Hara doesn't get much to do, but is a worthy looker. ██████ ██████, █████ ███████ and █████ █████████ provide able support.<br /><br />A fun and worthy spaghetti parody/homage that throws one curve-ball after another and many fruitful down 'n' dirty antics.
