"████ █████" is my favorite ██████ █████ movie, though he has made many great ones including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "████ █████", a cinematic expansion of ████ ████████'s searing stage play that was based on a real life account of a Dallas talk show host. Working with ace cinematographer ██████ ██████████, █████ turns what could have been a very set-bound exercise into a visually arresting ideological battle that presents a radio station as an arena of war. Bogosian is devastating as tortured on-air spouter of abuse █████ █████████ and conveys the conflicted, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-loathing. ████ ███████, as his Alpha male boss, strikes the perfect note as a man driven nuts by a guy whose monstrousness he helped nurture. █████ Greene is fantastic as █████'s sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of his vicious personal vitriol. █████ and Bogosian fill every frame with interest and every line of dialog with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. ████ C. McGinley, as █████'s long-suffering screener/technical producer ███, turns in a hilarious, sharp performance, as does the great ███████ ███████. The film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of superb writing, awesome acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. The ███████ ████████ score is brilliant, too.
