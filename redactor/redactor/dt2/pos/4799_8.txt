"███████" directed by ████ ██████ presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As written by the director and █████ █████████, his notable collaborator, this was a film that put Mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year. It's a disturbing film because ███ ██████ delves deep into what's wrong with the church.<br /><br />███████, by all reckoning, is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city. He doesn't have enough for himself, but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help. At the same time, he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman. ██████, the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building! ███████ is seen taking to the countryside begging for food. ██████ and ███████, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. ███████'s life parallels that of Jesus. In fact, this saintly figure makes a case for humility.<br /><br />Of course,███ ██████ had no religion in mind when he and ███ █████████ took it upon themselves to create this film. It's ironic how █████ welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing Christian qualities, when in reality, this is an acerbic satire on the catholic church and its ministers.<br /><br />Francisco █████, the Spanish actor, makes a wonderful ███████. This was one of his best roles. ██ █ █████ worked extensively in his native country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. ████ Macedo, as ██████, is also excellent. █████ █████ also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of ███████.<br /><br />A great film by one of the cinema's master film makers: ████ ██████.
