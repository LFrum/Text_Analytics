There's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee. The bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for $22 (closeup of tag). Later, ████ █████ finds the tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with him). Still later, ████ █████ is about to have an affair with ███████ ██████, looks at the price tag of HER silk negligee ($14) and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo, as well as the fact that she's spent $8 less than the "most obvious" woman she's ever met. It sounds an obvious morality turn, but it was well done. The film would be stronger if ██████ ████' character had been played by a more powerful actor (he's too low-key for a self-made salesman and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera), and if ███████ ██████ had been given more to do than smile ironically. Both male leads are bland and forgettable, and are hindered by the pancake male makeup so popular in this film's era. However, the ████ █████ character is interesting, appealing and believable. Behind Closed Doors is well worth seeing.
