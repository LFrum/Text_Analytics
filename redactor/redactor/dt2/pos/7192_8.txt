The second live action outing for ███████ is far better than the glued together elements of ten different stories that was called the first film, instead staying fairly close to the original comic.<br /><br />In a nutshell, █████ █████████ has made a bet with ██████ to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are a great people. █████ █████████ ██████ seeks the help of ███████, ██████ and druid Getafix to complete his task. There are several laugh out loud moments, some jokes that only the French might get (jibes at the 35 hour week) while others that are more universal. The big budget special effects are spectacular but overshadowed by the jokes from the original comic.<br /><br />Depardieu and ███████ still work brilliantly as a pair while ██████ ████████ makes perfect casting as █████████. Also, for fans of the comics the hilarious pirates get a look making up for their absence in film 1.
