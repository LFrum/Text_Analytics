tell you what that was excellent. █████ █████ is simply the funniest actor on screen( and on stage) and with ███████ █████ as your partner ain't to bad either, both are great to watch in a really funny film. true, not all the gags come off but its worth sticking around for the ones that do, but come on its got ███████ █████ in a dress in it( the whole admission fees worth that) and every time █████ █████'s on screen its more like Bernard blacks movie. the story is two actors(█████ and Caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by acting out different persona's to fool them all but getting away with it's a different matter. basically "the actors" is a great British comedy that was somehow missed by many, seriously if your a █████ fan(or want to see ███████ █████ in a dress) definitely see this
