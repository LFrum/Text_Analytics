████ and █████ bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce's assassin ████. While ██████ looks in the Book of Shadow how to vanquish the demon, ████ and █████ fight and chase ████ on the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. They become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. ██████ trusts on Cole and goes to the underworld with ███ to ask him to summon ██████ and revert time while a fanatic woman shots █████, who dies. The source proposes ██████ to stay with him and in return he would save her sister. ██████ accepts the deal, and the time is reverted to the moment ████ is attacking ████, █████ and Dr. Griffits.<br /><br />"All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good but incoherent episode. With █████ dead and The Power of █████ destroyed, why should The Source revert time to save her? But this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the Third ██████ and let the viewers anxiously waiting for the next episode. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Voltando no Tempo" ("Back in Time")
