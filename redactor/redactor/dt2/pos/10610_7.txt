███████ █████████ to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky, over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes █████ seem a bastion of conservatism. This perception is not helped by the whiff of condescension that permeates most movies that have approached █████████ from an outsider's perspective. ███████ ███████'s romantic comedy ████████, however takes a different tack. It is not a nudge-nudge wink-wink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of █████████ for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-consciousness.<br /><br />It is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for █████████ while at the same time is bemused by its kitschier aspects. And if you have a familiarity with █████████, you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of █████████ and Hollywood movie conventions. From one of the opening shots, a flashback of the ██████ character as a child by the sea, talking with his grandmother (played by █████! - how many ██████ movies start with this same premise?) to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that ████████ and Prem has been filming, anyone who has seen enough █████████ movies will recognize these references. The story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both Hollywood and █████████ as well  the fish out of water meets duty-to-one's-family-at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical █████████ plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second. Yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of Hollywood, with its understated, wry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself, to reach self-affirmation.<br /><br />You couldn't have a movie inspired by █████████ if there weren't any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them. Unlike █████████, however, the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a European locale or Goan beach; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made, reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as being part of a stage show. Or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there  a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches ████████ to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo from the playback singer █████) performing. All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie. Often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other. So in one of the highlights of the film where ████████ comes into her own, the song picturazation is fairly typical of its genre  the female star singing and dancing among a line of women  but in this case it's blond ███ ██████ looking like a total natural █████████ film star, emoting and lip synching to the Hindi lyrics with no subtitles.<br /><br />Also synonymous with █████████ are sumptuous visuals and ████████ fulfills that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in █████████ today. The cinematographer is ████ █████ who was also the cinematographer for ██████ and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is ████████ ████████ and production designer is █████ █████, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film  in fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from █████ ████ ████, which coincidentally has an embedded ████████ pattern.<br /><br />As for the cast, ███████ obviously has a penchant for spotting acting talent as evidenced by Playing by █████  one of the first movies for both Angelina Jolie and ██████ █████████. And in this film he again hits the mark with ███ ██████. One of the main reasons the film works is because of ██████. She makes a bitchy, unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart, funny, and sexy because she is smart and funny. She and ██████ share excellent chemistry and that is one of the film's biggest strengths.<br /><br />██████ ████ plays the role of Prince Charming here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem. This is old school Prem, however, so expect a quiet, subdued ██████ - those used to him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed  or relieved! It's a sincere and sensitive performance from him marred only by poor enunciation of his English lines.<br /><br />With a refreshing lack of cynicism and unabashed embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to █████████ and Hollywood movies of yore.
