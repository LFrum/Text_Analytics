I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. ██ ████ is in no way ██████'s buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is ██ ████'s reluctance to be friends with anybody.<br /><br />██████ really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. ██ ████ is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. ████ Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course, she loves everything ██████ does and tries so hard (along with ██████) to get ██Niro going too.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with ███████ ███████, reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train ██████ & ██ ████ how to "act" like cops. But, my favorite scene involves ██████ in the "confessional" hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop to team up with instead of ██ ████. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of ██████ and ██ ████...I think it brought out the best in ██████, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for ██████ to be paired with the great ██ ████. Rating 8 of 10 stars.
