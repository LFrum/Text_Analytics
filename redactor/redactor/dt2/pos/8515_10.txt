Background info - The movies █████████ & █████ ███ █████ █████ were both made the same year, 1983, and so naturally people compare them. Moore vs. ███████. ████ vs. ████.<br /><br />I've heard many people claiming that the "official movie" █████████ is far superior. Well, I just watched █████████. ████ is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour (impossible---the wind would blow him off), using his feet to force the plane to ground, and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour (again impossible---try jumping out of your car---you'd end up with a shattered body). How is that octopussy scene supposed to be "good" in any sense of the word? Suddenly ████ has super-human strength & a titanium body. And he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56??? Complete crap. Unbelievable. Farse.<br /><br />---> Now let's contrast the above scene with ███████'s "unofficial" █████ ███ █████ █████: It doesn't have the same polish due to its independent film status (less money), but at least you can believe that ███████ is a real spy in real danger.<br /><br />The movie starts off with ████ showing his age (he is 50 after all) and being sent off for recuperation. Entirely believable. But of course, there's no such thing as a "day off" for a world-famous spy, and ████ quickly finds himself a target, even inside the hospital. From that point the story spins off into another adventure, with ████ trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons.<br /><br />As usual Sean ███████ did a brilliant job, and avoids the over-the-top/unbelievable stunts. This movie feels like a natural successor to ███████'s last film, 1971's Diamonds Are Forever... the old style of ████... before the franchise got silly.<br /><br />███████ recommended.
