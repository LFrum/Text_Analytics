████ ███████ (██████) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers, her daughter ██████ and her mother Edie (Edie ██████). She's in competition with a couple named ██████ and ███████ ███████ (Mink Stole, █████ ███████) to be named the filthiest person alive. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other.<br /><br />This film is very much NOT for everyone. It's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste. Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches; the Marbles pick up female hitchhikers, impregnate them, keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples; ██████ and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc. It's disgusting but, in a way, not unwatchable. It's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. As director ████ ██████ might say, it's bad taste done well. Also it's kind of amusing to watch--the acting is so wretched (especially by ██████) that you just watch it in disbelief. A friend laughed out loud at how bad ██████ was (she improved in later pictures).<br /><br />This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even though it's over 30 years old it's STILL shocking. However if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a must-see. The only part that really was too much is what ██████ does at the very end.
