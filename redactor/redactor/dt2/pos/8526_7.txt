When I first saw this on tape, about 10 years after it had been released, I thought it was one of the better █████ ████ movies. However, after seeing it again around the turn of the century, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I think it's a bit overrated only because critics were so happy to see ████ ███████ end his 12-year hiatus from playing ████ that they didn't dare criticize the film. I guess what disappointed me was the ending. After investing two hours into the film, you expect a less-hokey, more satisfying ending. And, it may be nitpicking, but I was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as ████ ██████████, Q, █████ ██████, etc.<br /><br />On the positive side, there was plenty of unique action scenes, particularly early on, and the two villains were interesting. I thought █████ █████ █████████ was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low-key and looked the "nice guy next door." He wasn't your normal ████ villain.<br /><br />This had plenty of "skin," for a PG movie, especially with ███ ████████ starring, never being an actress known for hiding her figure. The language was very tame, but most ████ movies are pretty good in that department.<br /><br />All in all, it's a "fair" ████ and nothing else. Just because Connery is in it, it doesn't mean it's automatically good. █████ Moore and ██████ ███████ have proved they could play the role well, too.
