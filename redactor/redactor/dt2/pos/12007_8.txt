Fun movie! The script is awful but the quality of actors saves the day. ████ Hurt is perfect, as is ████ █████████. ████ Bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. The story is the true star. Based on a true story, the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping ████ ███████ sucks you in and holds you. Joyous ending provides enough elation to compensate for script. Don't expect ███████ █████ quality but it's a great ride for the whole family.
