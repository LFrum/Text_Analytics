I always thought the ██████ ███████ was a great sequel to ██████. The story was an interesting one and █████ ██████, ███████████ ██████ and ███████ ██████ gave great performances. Plus lets face it, ███ ██████ was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than ████ ███████████ ever did.<br /><br />Plot: ██████ █████████ also know as The Penguin(played By █████ ██████) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of Gotham with the help of his goons(Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon ███ ██████(played by ███████████ ██████). ███ ██████ later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle(████████ ████████) is pushed out of a window by ███ ██████ and is revived by cats. Later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy ███ ██████ and ██████. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.<br /><br />Opinion: ██████ ███████ is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. ███ ██████ always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. ███████ ██████ is still sharp as ██████. █████ ██████ steals the show as ██████ █████████/The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than ████ █████████. ████████ ████████ gave ████████ more personality than █████ █████ ever could. ███ ██████ is one of ███████████ ██████'s best roles. The main reason why I like ██████ ███████ is that its fun. Its not only creative but its also fun. Something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack. The ██████ series goes to the dogs after ███ ██████ decided to do no more. You don't believe me, look at ██████ Forever and ██████ and █████. Thank god that ███████████ █████ breathed life back into the series with ██████ ██████.
