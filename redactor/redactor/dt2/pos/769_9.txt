DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that sneaks up on you. What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy British style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly. ██████ ██████ █████ ('Mrs. █████', 'Charlotte ████', 'The Last King of Scotland') here directs his own screenplay and the result is a cohesive, progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters, each performed by sterling actors.<br /><br />███ Marshall (██████ █████, standing firmly on his own as a developing actor post 'Harry ██████' series) is a quiet, plain little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching █████ father (████████ ███████) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid, evangelical do-gooder mother (█████ ██████) in a home where 'needy people', such as the murderous cross-dressing ███ ███████ (███ ██████), take precedence over family matters: the mother is by the way having an affair with priest Peter (██████ ███████), using ███ as her cover! ███ ███ is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons AND needs to get a job to help pay for poor ███ ███████'s needs. ███ follows an ad and meets ████ ███ ██████ (█████ ███████), an elderly has-been actress who is as zany as any character ever created. She hires ███ and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip ████ demands they take, the two learn life's lessons missing from each other's natures: ███ learns self respect and self confidence and ████ finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hiding.<br /><br />█████ ███████, always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates, finds a role like no other here: she is outlandishly wild and lovable. ██████ █████ is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age ███. The chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film 'Harold and █████'. █████ ██████ is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire. And the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations. This film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting - and message! █████ Harp
