This is a very noir kind of episode. It begins with ███ returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced █████ █████ (███ ███████--daughter in law of ████ ██████, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. When they arrive, █████ goes in the house while ███ picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room. He then discovers █████ has disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls ██████ and when the police arrive, they see no sign of █████, but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. So of course that makes ███ an immediate suspect.<br /><br />This is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by █████ asking ███ to go over the story once again. █████ suggests that by ███ telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn't think was important at the time, but now might lead to a clue as to what happened. It's a really well written scene and completes the transition of the █████ character from a grifter to a concerned parent. It also goes a long way to show that █████ isn't just some clueless old man either. As he says "You come to me because I'm your father. And I'm smarter than you!" This is one of those times where we see where ███ got his smarts.<br /><br />This episode also features an appearance by hottie ████ ██████, who played █████████ in the "████ ███████" series and went on to play █████ ██████, █████'s wife in the "Incredible Hulk" series a few years later. She looks terrific here.<br /><br />This episode also marks the first mention of the Minette crime family, a name that would keep popping up on the Rockford Files almost whenever they needed a mob family. This time, its Vincent Minette who Rockford helps apprehend.<br /><br />Lt. Diehl (███ ██████) makes his first appearance on the series and ██████ is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police ███████. I guess they figured it would be better to have ██████ less powerful and add some conflict between ███ and the police. Frankly, they were right, though I prefer the later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl. <br /><br />Not a lot of the typical "Rockford" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.
