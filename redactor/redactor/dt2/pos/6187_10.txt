For some perverse reason best known to themselves these IMDb boards seem reluctant to credit the great █████ ██████ as co-scriptwriter on at least two (this one and Ninotchka) of his early classics when any buff can detect the ██████ hand at work. As it happens this represented the first time he was teamed with ███████ ████████ (who DOES get a credit) and it was a great start. One commenter has noted how satisfying it is to see these type of films in old-fashioned cinemas and I couldn't agree more. In Paris one of the smaller Revival houses shows in one of its salles a more or less continuous Lubitsch retrospective and I'm pleased to report that this played to a very appreciative audience right across the age spectrum though I doubt whether any were actually alive when it was first released in 1938. The famous ██████ schtick the meet-cute is particularly tasty here when millionaire but-careful-with-it Cooper attempts to buy half a set of pajamas in a department store on the Riviera and meets with sales resistance until █████████ ███████ turns up and agrees to buy the other half. The gag is milked even more when, having exhausted the chain of command at the store itself the manager places a call to the owner, who is in bed and leaves it to reveal that he, too, is only wearing the top half of pajamas. The film is full of sight-gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect. █████████ ███████ is only terrific and gets great backing from ██████ ███████ ██████ as her impoverished titled father. █████ Niven in fourth billing has some funny 'business' as does ████████ ████████ and if ████ ██████ is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal dexterity and sophisticated persona that ██████ scripts called for at this stage of his career well, you can't have everything and what you DO have is darned near perfect.
