Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli ██████ █████) bought by █████ ██████ and released through his New World Pictures. Of course ██████ has to carve his initials on it by having one of his lackeys (███ ██ ██████) direct some additional gore footage before he has it released in the states.<br /><br />L'Isola degli ██████ █████ is a very entertaining retelling of the Island of Dr. Moreau. It is 1891 and ███████ ██████████ is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts. Claudio comes across the stellar ███████ ████ and ███████ ███████. ███████ plays the dastardly ██████ ███████: a man who is able to manipulate scientist ██████ ██████ into turning the local native population into amphibious deep-sea diving creatures, (they look like a cross between the Black Lagoon creature and one of The Humanoids From the Deep), by convincing ██████ that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives.<br /><br />Having discovered the lost city of Atlantis, ███████ is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures. ████ ███████ ████ plays ██████'s daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations. In one memorable scene, ████ takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination. Claudio discovers one of the convicts he has befriended has been turned into a gill-creature and then all Hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Filmed at the same time and in the same location as Zombi 2, ███████ ███████ didn't even have to change suits between films. The house where the experiments take place is the same house ███████ uses to conduct experiments in Zombi 2. Talk about economic filmmaking!<br /><br />The additional footage features a few bloody beheadings, (way to go █████!), and a laughably bad ███████ ████████ doing his best pirate imitation. All that's missing is the parrot.<br /><br />Spanish title: ██ █████████ Des Hommes Poissons
