The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. ██████████ ███████'s discovery of "We've Only ████ █████" and █████'s marriage troubles admirably (the "Superstar" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with ████ ██████, the contribution of ████ ██████'s guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her █████ persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real █████████'s personality. ████████ is in fine form as the creative and take-charge ███████, and ████████ makes her mark as the loving but overbearing █████. The most haunting moment of the original broadcast is the use of "Goodbye to Love" in the background of a commercial displaying an anorexia hotline.
