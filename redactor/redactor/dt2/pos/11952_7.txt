This is from much of the same creative team behind "██████ ███ Dead", but is not quite as good as that amazing teen comedy. Its a lot of fun, but its all over the place and just not quite as funny. ██████ █████████ is used to less effect (he was incredibly funny in "Better off Dead", ██████ ███████████ is hilarious, Cusack is good, ████ █████ is ████ █████ (only with better hair here.) Overall its fun, and as a person from ████ ███, it catches the feeling of an 80s ████ ███ summer very effectively. For some reason, this film feels more "mainstream" than "Better off Dead". There isn't quite as much left field absurdity going on here. Again, if you are a fan of ████ ██████ and ██████ █████ ███████ its definitely recommended.
