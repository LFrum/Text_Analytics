█████, ████ and ██████ bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Source's personal assassin, ████. ██████ ██████ looks in the Book of Shadows for a spell to vanquish ████, ████ and █████ are attacked by ████ and chase him into the street. Unbeknownst to ████ and █████, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television. With ██████ in the Underworld, ████, █████, and ███ must find a way to reverse the damage done. ███ goes down to ██████, and tells her that the ███████ Ones have been exposed as witches. On the surface, █████ is shot by a manic witch-wannabe, and ████ has to take her to the hospital. The problem here is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. So ████ has to use her magic on the crowd, and they go to the hospital. █████ is pronounced dead, and a SWAT team moves in. ███ learns of █████'s death, and goes down to tell ██████. Cole is asked to ask The Source to reset time, and The Source agrees; only if ██████ turns to the dark side. ██████ agrees, but the deal will shatter them. Up on the surface, ████ and █████ are battling ████. ████ shouts out for ██████, who unbeknownst to them is in the Underworld. ████ throws █████ and ████ through a wall, and Dr. Griffiths out of a window. ████ is not pronounced dead until the Season 4 Premiere episode, "███████ █████, ████ ███".<br /><br />"All Hell Breaks Loose" is a gripping episode, and it made me sit on the edge of my seat. ███ that ████'s dead, but happy that there will be five more seasons of ███████. My vote; 10 out of 10. EXCELLENT
