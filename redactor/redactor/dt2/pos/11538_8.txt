I've never really been sure whether I liked this documentary or not. It was shown on Channel 4 before a cut down version of Revelations, and is on the Revelations video tape before the uncut show. The documentary is basically friends of ████ saying how great he was for an hour with video clips of the show mixed in, a bit like a trailer for the film you're about to watch. It also features █████ █████████ grovelling like a worm for dumping ████ off the his show before he died, the reason? ████ made a joke about how Pro-Life people should picket funerals, and █████████ had Pro-life advertising. Anyway look out for the video as Revelations is ████ at his ranting best :)
