I have always loved The ██████s. Though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, The ██████'s was. The ██████'s are very, very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters ever. <br /><br />Not only did The ██████s have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The ██████'s Christmas carol to The ██████'s treasure Island. The first ██████'s movie, The ██████ movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.<br /><br />The ██████ movie is about how they all got started. ██████ the frog used to live in a swamp. Until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in █████████. So ██████ takes off for █████████. Along the way he runs into lots of people such as ██████ ████, Gonzo the great, and ████ █████. Also, an evil man is trying to capture ██████.<br /><br />All of the ██████ films are highly enjoyable. I mean they are all very funny. This film has many film appearances. Such as █████ ██████, ███ ██████, ██████ █████, █████ ████, ███████ █████, and █████ ██████. The ██████ films are all very enjoyable. I hear that █████ █████ is going to star in one soon. I can't wait to see it.
