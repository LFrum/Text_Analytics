The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. ██████ █████████. Ms. █████████ dominates this film with her tremendous presence as █████, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, with no strings attached. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing.<br /><br />Thanks to director ██████ ████ for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place.<br /><br />Of course, none of this would have been possible if █████ ████████ ██████ hadn't written his wonderful play. Working with ███ ████, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of Ms. Crosby, when his own parents are not around to take care of him. Ms. Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little █████; in a way, he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no time to develop some of the characters, as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between █████ and the young █████, played with such charm by the young ██████ ████ ████████, who is a natural. The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive, as it doesn't clarify, or justify what one is seeing. Frankly, just by watching the interaction of the players, is self explanatory.<br /><br />In the background there is always music. No matter what hard times these people are going through, but █████'s house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era.<br /><br />Aside from Ms. █████████, other notable performances are given by ████████ ██████ ██████, one of the rising stars of the moment. Mos Def, ███████ ██████, █████ ████, █████ ███████ ██ █,██████ █████, █████ █████, ██████ █████, █████ █████ and the rest.<br /><br />Ms. S. ██████ █████████ deserves to be seen by a wider audience. In "██████████ █████", she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma.
