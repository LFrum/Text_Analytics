I am a big fan of ████████ ████ and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was happy to see that they finished up with Comanche moon. I have been a long time fan of █████ ████ and was eager to see him in a serious role. I personally think that █████ ████ has done an amazing job of re-creating ███. I can't think of another actor who would have been better. He has the voice, the mannerisms, the pronunciation of word all down to a T. Granted, no one could ever hold a candle to ██████ ██████ as ███, but I think that █████ ████ has done a pretty darn good job. ████ Urban acts the same in all the movies he has been in so he has made a good match for ███████ ████. AS for the movie itself, yeah it's a little corny but can you really beat ████████ ████? No, I don't think so.
