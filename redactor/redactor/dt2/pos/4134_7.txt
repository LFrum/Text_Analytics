I've got to say it. ████ █████ saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.<br /><br />The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is ███████ green and hilly? How come █████'s producer █████ ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is █████████ treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the █████ sound? Why was █████'s two week courtship to █████ treated as a complex, taboo, race mixing stereotype? Why are █████'s tile boxes as light as feathers? Finally, why are the Crickets portrayed as trouble making roadblocks to █████'s talent?<br /><br />Taken on their face these inaccuracies should spell doom for any film proclaiming itself, "The █████ █████ Story." However, █████ does deliver a stirring portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died.
