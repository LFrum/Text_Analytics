Typically Spanish production - slow-moving, but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the lead actress ███ ████. (Watch her in "Spanglish"). Great sets, lots of colour - you get to see ███████, Seville, Spanish mountains and countryside. The plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow closely (I managed to, even though the film is in Spanish), you'll get the gist of it.<br /><br />It's about how one very highly sensual young Gypsy woman, ██████, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding. ██████ is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigarera at the cigar factory where she works. She persuades ████, the soldier in charge of taking her to prison, to let her escape. ████ succumbs to her charms because she speaks Basque (he is Navarrese and speaks the same language). ████ is punished by 1 month in jail and demoted to foot soldier. He later meets ██████ at a party and they end up becoming lovers. But ██████ refuses to commit to him, and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle. In a jealous rage, ████ kills a fellow soldier who has been with ██████. They then have to leave town. Life on the run turns ████ into a bandit. ██████, meanwhile, remains the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. In the end, ████ loses his mind and ends up killing ██████.<br /><br />The story is told by ████ in prison, awaiting to be executed. The person he tells the story to is ████████ ███████, a French writer and anthropologist, whose fancy watch (it plays █████████'s Fur Elise) was stolen by either ██████ or ████.<br /><br />Worth watching for the sets and for the delectable ███ ████.
