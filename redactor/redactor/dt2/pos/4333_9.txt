I couldn't' agree more than with the comment left by "coldshitaction" and how this film is a masterpiece. I have never seen a film that had my adrenalin flowing that this film did, and that mostly happened when ███████ comes running out a fire escape with like an M-60 and plows down like 20 dude from a gang, it's genius. Quite possibly the best action movie ever made (no exaggeration either), it really could be the best action movie ever made. From the start, one should know that you;re in for something sweet when the police let ███████ go and tell him, tell him, to clean up the slums. Once again, genius. And once again ███████ is a bad ass. ████ Kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than ████ ███████ or the Terminator, he's just simply a bad ass. And what else is great is the fact that he's a nice guy and buys a kid some ice cream and helps out an old couple all before he kills some scum bag. genius. ██████ recommended, if you hate this movie you're crazy.
