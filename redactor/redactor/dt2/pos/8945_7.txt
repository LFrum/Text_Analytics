A humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business. It's easy watching, and even offers ███████ & Molina stealing a scene from an old Fred & ██████ movie. Walken is over the top as a zealous competitor of Molina in the undertaking business, trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh town. We see a couple of very funny examples of the "new style". The plot thickens with Pugh having an affair with █████, and her suggesting that they do ███████ in. Meanwhile Molina has rekindled his long suffering romantic feeling for ███████, and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the South Seas, and dance away their days together. During the "fake" funeral ███████ learns of her husbands' infidelities and plots her revenge. Watch it for a view of what funerals probably should be--a celebration of life!
