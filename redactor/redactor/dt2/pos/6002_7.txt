This was a truly epic production that had all the elements that one would want in a fantasy film. The costuming, the music, the cinematography - all artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience.<br /><br />Ted ██████, best know for his TV roles in "Cheers" and "becker," was excellent in the role of Gulliver. ████ Steenburgen (████ After ████, █████ █████) performed equally well in her limited role as his wife.<br /><br />Other performances I really enjoyed were █████ ███ as Dr. Bates, █████ ███████ as the Queen of Brobdingnag, and █████ ███████ as the Emperor of Lilliput.<br /><br />This would make an enjoyable children's film, but it also would definitely appeal to adults for it's deep social commentary.
