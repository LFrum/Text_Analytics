███ ███████ in his prime stars as █████ █████, a mental asylum escapee who poses as his own shrink to travel out to ██ ██ ████ and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host (██████ ██████ in his snarling prime) takes a vacation. Along the way, ███████ hooks up with ██████ ███████, a fellow nutjob, and the rest is sheer hilarity. ███████ and ███████ play off very well off one another. ███████'s stunning real-life wife, █████ █████, is along for the ride as yet another shrink. The ending feels a bit rushed and contrived, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my top rating, an 8. A lost '80s gem.
