Like the 5-year old protagonists of his latest opus, █████ ████████'s "█████" enchants with its unbridled innocence as though the anime-meister has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that relishes in its simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process. ████████, recalling his earlier works, paints a brightly-colored world obviously geared for the younger audiences and the raw effervescence gleefully strips off the grim thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors.<br /><br />█████ (voiced lovably by █████ ████), a fish with a young girl's face (making her look like a cuddly child in a pink overgrown █████████ costume), escapes away from her underwater home and her school of siblings to explore the surface. Stranded ashore, she is rescued by ██████ (Hiroki Doi), a five-year old boy who, along with his mom Risa (██████ █████████), resides in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial encounter and, eventually, friendship, has a profound effect on █████ who now wishes to become human, but by becoming so inadvertently tips nature's balance and unleashes a maelstrom on land. With ██████'s help, █████ must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human.<br /><br />Despite the plot lacking the philosophical sophistication of, say, his most recent "Spirited Away," "█████" is nothing short of an astounding follow-up, characterized by the extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic, and of the simple joys and great fears. It's a straightforward tale that, though at times stalled by its tendency to ramble like a toddler, keeps in tune with its youthful pedigree to magically enthrall. "I will protect you," ██████ tells █████ matter-of-factly, a childlike assertion not unlike the manner in which ████████ endows his story with artful spirit.
