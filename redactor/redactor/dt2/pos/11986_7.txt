One has to take ██████ & █████ like a dash of salt & pepper. Why does ██████ put up with █████? Then again, why do all the women in this movie like █████? Because he is innocently likeable! ██████ sings a few good songs (lip-sync'd at least once) and █████ manages to kiss more girls than in all his other movies combined. I generally find that I can take just so much of █████'s antics before they become aggravating. BUT.... in this film, watch when █████ gets stuck outside on a submerging ████ submarine! EXCELLENT! ██████ ██████ should have been proud. I give the film a 7.
