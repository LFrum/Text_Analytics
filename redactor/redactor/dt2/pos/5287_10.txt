Few would argue that master animation director █████ ████████ is one of the few to hold this ability.<br /><br />(No. Too many are focused on ████ ████████'s "amazing" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.)<br /><br />████████ has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. Still, ████████ (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children.<br /><br />That said, I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew Link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece Amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the "star power" of ███████ █████ and ████ █████, a 12 year old (my nephew █████) who's review was "of course it was good! Everything ████████-san does is good!," a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and I'm betting the older charas too) and loving the "cuteness" of the child characters.<br /><br />And that is what I respect most about ████████-san. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. On the surface, "█████" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names █████ (somewhat like "The Little Mermaid"), but there is an entire different level at play here. True to form, ████████ populates his film with intensely strong female characters █████'s Mother, █████'s mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.<br /><br />But the girl who takes the cake is █████ herself. Once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young █████ knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. <br /><br />Once human, she teams up with her friend, █████, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). █████ is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother ████ decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by █████ on her quest to become human. ███████ █████ (yes. He's related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young █████ (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific.<br /><br />In the end, █████'s father, ████████ must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human. He hopes that █████ and █████ will "remember him fondly." And once again, ████████ ███████ to allow a character to become the stereotypical "bad guy." Although ████████ has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. No one in real life is completely a "bad person." All humans are various shades of gray. And that is exactly what ████████ does with his characters. <br /><br />And then there's the animation itself. In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, ████████ has chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever. Certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and I, for one, was extremely grateful for that. The character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. This is what animation used to look like- and what it SHOULD look like. <br /><br />In the end, I found █████ to be thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly not ████████'s best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by ████'s Delivery Service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family.
