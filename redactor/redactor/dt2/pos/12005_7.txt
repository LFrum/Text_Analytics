And I do. █████ Falk has created a role that will live on forever in TV land! And I'm grateful for that. This isn't one of his finest hours, though. ███████ goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime, and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they're smarter than he is. What all us fans know is that ███████ needs a worthy opponent. Without a great enemy, how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat? Still, it's better than NO ███████, and I'll wait and watch the next one as well.
