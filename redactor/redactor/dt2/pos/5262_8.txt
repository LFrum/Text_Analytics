A terrific comedy-drama about the powers of friendship. Despite it's a remake of a 1939 film of the same title, it would probably be compared to ███ And The City. I would not compare to it totally. The story starts with ████(███ Ryan) who seems to the life most women would envy, she's happily married, has a good daughter, great friends, and a great home. But █████ perfect life isn't what it seems, when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with Crystal(███ ██████) from Zach's. ████ is puzzled and doesn't know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia(███████ ██████), Edie(█████ ███████), and Alex(Jada Pickett Smith) try to be there for her in anyway they can. I really don't want to give anymore away. But I found this enjoyable, and I'm a man. ███ Ryan is great, it is nice to see her in on the screen again, after a series of flops. And the rest of the cast are also great including ███ ██████ as Crystal. Just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy.
