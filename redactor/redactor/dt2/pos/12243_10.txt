This movie has everything going for it: Fully developed characters, a realistic portrayal of working Washington, bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely ██████ ██████. The dumbing down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987. Remember, this was pre-cable! So satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals -- and it all moves along with lightning speed. Such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance. See if you can spot ████ ██████ as the angry messenger! And do you recognize █████ ██████ from real life █████████ ████? Finally, if you're from DC, see if you agree with █████ ██████'s directions to cab drivers!
