Yes!! They finally got it down to perfection. What a great idea, a refreshing exploitation epic for Generation-X, whether they know it or not. After disasters like Sgt. █████████ NYPD, and getting screwed by ███████████, our hero, █████ ███████ just decided to go for it, stop catering to distributors, and let █████ be all the █████ it can be. █████ would make this one the most unapologetic, outlandish and downright hilarious █████ movie yet. This time, █████ takes ███████████'s love story, turns it inside out, █████tizes it, and adds that long, lost, entertainment value it was always lacking. Entertainment value, such as █████ █████████ (the narrator), ██████ ██████ (the cook), ███ ██████████ (the fat guy), and of course, brutal mutilations and toilet humor. ██████ And Juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story, and the crown jewel of the █████ universe.<br /><br />Years ago, in █████ville, N.J. business partners, █████ ███ and ███ ███████ start a film company called █████ █████, which would produce supposedly tasteful, soft core films. █████ considers ███ his friend, but ███ is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company. On paper, and in books, it appears that █████ gave away his life's work for free. Fast forward to mid-90's Manhattan, we have two families who are extremely displeased with one another, it's to the point that they're just looking for a reason to take a limb, or preferably, a life. █████ has a son, ██████, nephew, █████, they, with their friend, ██████ ███████, who's just a little too excited about all the carnage, wage war on the incestuous ███ulets, except █████, he's too drunk to care. Like in the original, there is a confusing situation, leading to ██████ falling for ███'s daughter, who he has never met, or never even knew about. Unfortunately, ███ is a sadistic pervert, who, not unlike ██████'s dad, has a thing for the bottle, and this would of course, lead to daddy's little chenshaw melon being physically, and emotionally abused, and molested, and kept in a Plexiglas cage, off and on, depending on how foul of a mood ███ is in. ███ is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry ██████ ████████, a billionaire butcher, who, would make just about anyone uneasy, with or without the raisin loaf. With all these inconveniences, the young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision, but how will this effect the big feud? It might, or might not, go a little something like the original, but figuring out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen, you'll never see it coming.<br /><br />"The one with ███" is downright sleep-inducing compared to ██████ & Juliet, but if watered-down, over-directed, big-budget, Hollywood, ███████ is what you've been programmed to go for, then by all means, go for it, but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really packs a punch, and doesn't follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor, then you just might not hate this movie. ██████ And Juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream. Full-blast exploitation with as much mean-spirited humor as anything from a young ████ ██████. Along with some badass acting, ██████ And Juliet flaunts a thunderous score which includes the legendary Motorhead, and not to mention, much input from █████ ████, that really brought this one together. For more awesomeness from █████ ████, check out █████████, and for more excellence from █████ ███████, check out his next vision, ██████ ██████. ██████ And Juliet is jaw-droppingly priceless Exploitation for the 90's brought to us by the one, and only, king of the B-movies. Thank's, █████. 10/10
