I always liked listening to █████ █████ and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, █████ █████ or █████ ███ █████, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.<br /><br />So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job ████ █████ did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice. He did █████ proud, as were the actors (Don Stroud and ███████ ██████ █████) who played █████'s backup group, "The Crickets."<br /><br />Music-wise, there are some of █████'s better-known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as █████ and the boys are shown in Iowa in their last concert ever. █████ not only sings like █████, he's a dead ringer for him in the looks department. Some thing was the actor''s best performance ever, and you get no argument from me.<br /><br />I'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that Iowa concert, instead of dwelling on his tragic accident. The ending could have been a real downer, but they didn't let it be.
