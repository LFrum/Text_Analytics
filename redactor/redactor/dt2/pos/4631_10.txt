I think that this film is one of the funniest films i have ever seen. I think ██████ ████████ is hilarious and the chemistry between her and █████ ████ is perfect. There is not a dull moment in the film and ██████ looks beautiful as always. <br /><br />The story is about a showgirl ██████(██████ ████████) who meets a penniless soldier ███ (█████ ████). She takes an instant dislike to him but after he accidentally tears her dress, he returns it to her on the condition that she goes on one date with him. They end up getting married the night they have their date after just one kiss. ███ and ██████ move to Spain and find they have nothing in common but physical attraction, so ██████ proposes that for one month they live but not as man and wife which means that ███ is not allowed to kiss or sleep with ██████, much to ███'s frustration.A hilarious plot and a wonderful film. Not to be missed.
