[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]<br /><br /> ████████ and his owner ███ ████████ were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. ███ even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles' bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and ███ hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: ███ killed it. ███ next tried to pick up girls at the video store. He ended up feeling down in the mouth. Literally. The laundromat was no prize either when ███ and his would-be date get a glimpse of each other's underwear. ███ tried to act all buff at the beach, but soon he angered a real buff guy, which left ███ feeling, once again, down in the mouth. Literally. ███ then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by. No avail. ███ pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat, a fat man walked up and stomped ███'s guitar. It was hopeless.<br /><br /> Fortunately for ███, an ad flashed on the TV: an ad for ███████'s School for the Personality Impaired. It guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. ███ and ████████ attend the class. The building didn't exactly look the same way it did on TV, nor did ███████ act as peppy as he did on TV. ███ sat next to a pretty girl named ████. So while ███████ taught his lessons of introducing yourself, checking your pulse, and pretending to speak a foreign language, ███ and ████ get to know one another. They leave together, forgetting all about ████████. At home, ███ and ████ just sat on the porch and talked. ████████ was jealous of ████ for fear that she would take ███ away from him. ████████ envisioned the future: ███ and ████ get married, she moves in, and soon she gives birth to a little Arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling ████████'s tale. Back to the present, ████████ would not stand for it. He tried to get ███ to get rid of ████, until she started scratching behind his ears. But then ███ learned that ████ was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other every now and then, and ████████ was sure to be with them.<br /><br /> Another hilarious ████████ TV special! This one was made during the run of TV's ████████ and Friends. ████████ was slimmed down somewhat. SOMEwhat. Since hie early 1980's cartoons. The scenes of ███ trying to pick up chicks is funny, so is the one where the fat guy stomps on ███'s guitar. Good ol' ███████ █████ is back as ████████. ████ Huge is ███. █████ Welker (The third man of 1,000 voices) is ███████. And June Foray (The woman of 1,000 voices) is ████.
