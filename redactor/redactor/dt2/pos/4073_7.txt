I went to see this movie not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the teaming of ██████ ██ ████ and █████ ██████. It was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast. This one certainly won't win any Academy Awards but it was a change of pace for ███ ██ ████. He is good in comedy. Overall I enjoyed it.
