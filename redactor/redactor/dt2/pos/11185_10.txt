The Curse of ██████ ██████. Released excactly 6 years after the success of ██████ ██████ 2. You would think with ██████ ██████ 2's wierd ending that it would finish ██████ ██████ once and for all. But, it all turned out to be a trick to lure ████████ into captivity. But enough about that, the whole jist of this is that ██████ ██████ has returned, and the voices are just phenominal. If LucasArts were to make a movie/cartoon of ██████ ██████, this would probably be what it would look like, and sound like. It's plot is real good, and everything about it is just awesome. If you haven't heard about the ██████ ██████ series, buy the ██████ ██████ Archives or The ██████ ██████ Booty Pack and play through all the games starting with The Secret of ██████ ██████, then ██████ ██████ 2, and The Curse of ██████ ██████. ██████ ██████ 4 was real good, but this one tops them all.
