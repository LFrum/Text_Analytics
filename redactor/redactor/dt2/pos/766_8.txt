I really only watched this movie because it had ██████ █████ in it (who I knew as ███ from the Harry Potter movies). I had never really appreciated ██████ as an actor until this movie. I loved the entire film. ██████ does a wonderful job in this hilarious, quirky movie. I think the movie could have been fine without the sex, but it worked somehow. I can't wait to see more of ██████'s films in the future. █████ Walters also did an amazing job. In the Harry Potter movies, she has a very small role, so I didn't quite know what to expect from her either. But she was wonderful as ████ ████. The part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious. Overall, an amazing movie.
