When you think of brilliant Australian comedy you don't think of Skit shows (Although I'm quite partial to a bit of 80's and 90's Full Frontal) or even ███████ - you think of SATIRE! Something that we Australians really know how to do well. (Eg: █████ ████, The Micallef Program) We know how to take the pi$$, and The ██████'s War on Everything, is a classic example of how to do it, and how to do it really well. <br /><br />I've been a huge fan of █████ ██████ and █████ █████████ for a long time. I remember listening to them on ██████ █'s afternoon show. They were, and remain, two of the funniest comedians around.<br /><br />Although I was sad when they left ██████ █, I was excited to find out what they were investing so much time in that made them have to leave. (They were doing CNNNN and ██████ █ at the same time, so I figured this was something much bigger) And what an amazingly HILARIOUS show ██████ is. Biting political and social satire at it's best.<br /><br />I'm also pleased to say that it has recently received a MUCH better time slot than Friday nights and has been moved to Wednesday nights right after ██████ and Specks. THANK YOU ABC!! Finally I don't have to tape it! :)
