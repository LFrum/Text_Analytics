Went to the Preview Engagement of "█████ ████████" today (Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a couple of other Texas cities). There are so few movies suitable for young children...but this one is, and it's great. Though the plot is a little "Hokey" (also the name of the steer in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. And I enjoyed it, too. <br /><br />The film pretty well represents West Texas ranch family life, although a little exaggerated. Director/Author █████ ████ ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment. He called the film his "love letter to Texas." <br /><br />████ ██████ █████ plays the single mom of Buddy (█████ ██████) and ██████ 'Blow' (Emma Roberts). █████ Emma Roberts (█████ ███████' niece); she's very good and I think she will be in more films. There are also cameo appearances from █████ ███████, █████ ██████, musicians ██████ ██████, ███████ ███████, ██████ ████ ████, ███ ███ and rodeo legends █████ █████ and ████ Hedeman.<br /><br />If you have young children or just want to see a feel-good movie, check out "█████ ████████" when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month). Y'all will enjoy it and it WILL make you feel good.<br /><br />I guess since I'm from West Texas, I might be a little biased...nah, I'm impartial. The film is excellent!
