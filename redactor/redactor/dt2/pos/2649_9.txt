Dear Readers, 2001: A █████ ███████ is ███████ at his best...although I really can't say that as █████ ███████ is his only film I've ever watched. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good.<br /><br />The movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also ███████ ███████████ blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of ███' sequence. Then there's the odd 'Finding of the Monolith' sequence on the Moon, played to ███████'s ████ ██████. Finally things get good with the Spaceship scenes and HAL going berserk and killing people. After that things die down and we have the 'Entering the Monolith' sequence which was WAY too long and the ultra-strange ending. Even though, 2001: A █████ ███████ is a good film. It's not ████ ████, Stargate, ██████████, or The Abyss, but it rocks. My compliments to the chef, ██ █ ███████.<br /><br />Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
