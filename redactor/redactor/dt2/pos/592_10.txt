I am 17, and a biased Muppet fan, and while I love ████████ ██████, █████████ █████ and █████ ██████ █████, The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. It is enormously entertaining, thanks to the snappy script by █████ ████, and the film looks lovely, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, sure they aren't the best song score out of the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially █████ ██████. █████ ██████ is now one of my favourite Muppet songs along with █████ ████ It ███████ and Professional Pirate. The Muppets as usual were fantastic, particularly the always delightful Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between ██████ and ██████ was great. And what a brilliant human cast- from ███ ████ to █████ ██████, from █████████ ████(the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like What's Up ███?, ███████ ███████ and Clue) to ██████ ████████, from █████ ██████ to ███████ █████, all of whom made memorable guest appearances, if careful not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox
