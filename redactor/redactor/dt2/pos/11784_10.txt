Nothing is sacred. Just ask █████ █████████. These days, everybody has a video camera, and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying, quickly written and shot, and often posted directly to the internet. Spoofs are hot these days, and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don't get off on their own self-importance. 25 years ago, when the first ████ ████ was made, it was a different world. Filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare. Then ███ gave us ████████ ████. It was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. Does that take away from the experience? HECK NO! That's what makes it so great! It was raw and unpolished, and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie. From █████ ██████████ waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (I did that when I was young!) to Chewchilla the Wookie Monster, to ██████ ███ ██████'s "nah, just a little headache" remark, this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual ████ ████ films. Rent it. Buy it. Borrow it from a friend. And may the Farce be with you. Always.
