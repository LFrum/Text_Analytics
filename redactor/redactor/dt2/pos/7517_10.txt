Absolutely corrosive! ████████ ██████ ██████ and writer █████ █████████ dismantle the American hospital system with this wicked comedy/drama/whodunit. The hospital depicted here is fraught with problems...from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose. ██████ C. █████ is the top doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with free-spirited █████ ████ and her wacky father ███████ ██████. Alternately depressing and uproarious, THE HOSPITAL features some of the most acid-tinged dialog imaginable (note how █████ describes his love making session with ████). It also has a lot of great vignettes: █████ berating head nurse █████ ████████ after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor; daffy administrator ███████ ██████████ trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people; █████ getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful home-life. All of the acting is first-rate. █████ and ████ are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The movie is a masterpiece with █████████'s script earning a well-deserved Oscar (over such stiff competition as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narration is priceless.
