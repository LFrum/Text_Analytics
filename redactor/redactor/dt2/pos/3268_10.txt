<br /><br />`<br /><br />5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.<br /><br />███████ ██████████ film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as █████████, ██████ █████, ███████, ██████ ███ and ██████ People.<br /><br />In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.<br /><br />Set in Sydney's █████ █████, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town. █████, played by █████ █████, is a Sydney Mob boss. He's the king of organised crime wearing thongs, carrying a stubby and helping his son with his origami. He's vicious, but real. As are his mob', holding gun's to someone's head in one scene and then playing boardgames in the next. They are well respected and if they ask you for a favour, you don't say no.<br /><br />Enter █████, played by █████ ██████. █████ is your average Aussie guy in his early twenties. He's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without getting on anyone's bad side, so when █████ asks █████ to deliver $10,000, █████ accepts.<br /><br />Things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal the money while █████ is at the beach. So now █████ is $10,000 in dept to a major mob boss. From here we start to see all the interconnecting stories with █████ and his attempt at a bank robbery to recover the money, █████ and Alex (the love interest, played by ████ █████), █████ trying to find █████ and, of course, the two teenagers and their new found prosperity. The concept is deepened by the narrator, █████'s dead brother, ███████, who was killed by █████ and his gang years earlier.<br /><br />In the end all the storylines connected really well with a surprise twist to shock and stun the audience. I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />
