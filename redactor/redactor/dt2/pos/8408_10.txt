I loved the movie. I loved ███████ ██████ and ██████ ██████. The movie had many different locations in it. I really liked when ███ ███████ realized she could not make █████ love her. And when ████████ and ███ where together and ███ apologizes for taking █████ and ████████ just told her not to worry she would get him back. It had a great story it told. You just can not compare it to GWTW. It just has so many great scenes. I love both SCARLETT AND GWTW! Of course do not forget to have a hankie handy.
