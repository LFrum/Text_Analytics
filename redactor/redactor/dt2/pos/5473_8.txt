Seriously any film with ████ █████████ is usually very good. And this includes █████ ████████, ████ █████, ████ ███████ (Frasier), █████ █████████ (The Practice), and many more great actors.<br /><br />█████ is getting old now but thanks he is also an awesome director (in his own right).<br /><br />We are used to ████████ "water films" like ███ ████, ████████ and ███████ █████ - this was really different but just as sublimely directed.<br /><br />The premise of the assassin is as serious as it comes, the film is well paced, some of the violence is a bit... But altogether recommended (but not for kids).
