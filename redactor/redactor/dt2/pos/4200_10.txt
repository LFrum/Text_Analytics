I had heard of ████ ████████, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. ████ ████████ is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue. My favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one Dead End ███ couldn't swim, AND none of them could get out.████'s character saves the day. The Dead End ███s were great as his friends and followers. One of them right to the very end. ███ ████████ played the family's daughter and ████'s eventual love interest. She was believable, but not lovable in my opinion-the only weak link in the movie.
