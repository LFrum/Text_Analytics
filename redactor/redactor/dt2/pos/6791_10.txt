National Velvet (1944) The movie that put ██████ on the map. Costarring the then number one box office champ, ██████ ██████. ██████ plays a girl in love with her horse and when jockey ██████ ██████ is unable to ride in the Grand National race, spunky Liz cuts her hair, pretends to be a boy and races the horse to...well I won't spoil the end for you. It's quality melodrama that MGM was famous for putting out. And it's another early color picture to boot!
