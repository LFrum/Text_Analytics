█████ █████████ is █████, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg ███████), and who is married to ███, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while █████ secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that ███████ is really the character he plays, Dr. █████ ██████, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk. Pursuing her are ███████ and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and █████ ████ respectively), the hit men who inadvertently killed ███ before they found out where the drugs were hidden. They pursue her across the country, while ███████ gradually falls in love with his image of her.<br /><br />And in LA, things get totally bizarre, as no one realizes that █████ is delusional. Alternately funny and touching, this movie is almost perfect. Stop reading commentaries and go see it.
