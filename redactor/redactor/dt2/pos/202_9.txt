In Moscow, the young couple ████████ (T. █████████) and █████ (███████ ███████) are in deep love for each other. With the World War II, █████ volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before ████████'s birthday, and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news from █████, ████████ is raped by █████' cousin ████ (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, ████████ does not forget █████, and keeps waiting for him.<br /><br />"Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war. The direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story, inclusive in the capital scene when ████████ is raped by ████. The camera-work is amazing, with sophisticated planes and angles, and long traveling. The scenes of ████████ in the middle of the tanks, or in the train station with many figurants are awesome. The magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD. T. █████████ has an extremely beautiful face, and a touching and sensitive performance. The speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti-war movie. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "██████ ████ as Cegonhas" ("When Fly the Stork")
