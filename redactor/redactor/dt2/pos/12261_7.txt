From producer/writer/Golden █████ nominated director █████ ██ ██████ (Terms of Endearment, As Good as It Gets) this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter/anchor/journalist or producer might be like. █████████ ████ █████ (█████ and Golden █████ nominated █████ ██████) falls for new reporter ███ ███████ (█████ and Golden █████ nominated ███████ ████), but correspondent █████ ██████ (█████ nominated ██████ ██████) also has strong feelings for her. The network prepares for big changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio. Also starring ████ █████████ as anchor ████ ██████, █████████'s ████ ██████ as ████████ ████, Mrs. █████████'s ██████ ██████ as █████ ████████, School of Rock's ████ ██████ as █████ ██████, █████ ██████ as ████ █████, █████████ █████████ as █████, ██████ ██████ as ██████ █████, ██ ███████ as ██████ ████ and ███████ ████████ as ██████ ███████. The comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has it's moments, and it is certainly a believable situation film. It was nominated the █████s for ████ ██████████████, ████ ████ ███████, ████ ███████, ██████████ ███████ ████████ for the Screen and ████ ███████, and it was nominated the Golden █████ for ████ ██████ ███████ - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture. It was number 64 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!
