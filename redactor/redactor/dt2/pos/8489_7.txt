'███' lives on<br /><br />███ Dir- ██████ ████████ Cast- █████ ████, █████ ██████████, ██████ ████, ███████ ██████, ██████ █████████ and ██████ ██████. Written by- ██████ ████████ and █████ ██ █████. Rating- ***<br /><br />"Hit the road ████, and don't come backno more, no more, no more, NO MORE!" Who would've thought that this immortal line that has almost become a remedial mantra for broken relationships in popular culture was conceived over a lovers' brawl! ███ ███████ was a genius. And if there was one thing that he knew, breathed and lived for; it was music. So in a lifetime that comprised acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful affairs; ███ still found moments when inspiration hit him out of nowhere and words and notes took their own shape to form an instant eternal classic! <br /><br />There are some lives that deserve to be transformed on the silver screen. ███ ███████'s life was one of them. It almost comes as a shock to learn that this project had no studio-backing until it was completed! And that backing probably came after the initial screenings where █████ ████'s performance was lauded and predicted as a surefire █████ winner in hushed voices. █████ ████ as ███ almost convinces us that it is indeed ███ ███████ performing on screen and not an actor impersonating! From the crooked all-knowing smile to the bent gait of not so much a handicapped but a man dancing through his demons, ████ captures every essence of the actual ███ ███████. ███ was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and very rarely showed it himself. An astute businessman, he ensured his success at any cost, sometimes at the price of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his philandering ways and always maintained that he loved his family, which we are convinced he did. He liked sex; it was as simple as that! But beneath all, there also existed a ███ that was afraid of darkness. Imagine the horrors of a blind man afraid of darkness! His fear was because of his guilt. ███ was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death, and his whole life was spent trying to redeem himself. ███ was a maverick who fused gospel with jazz, an unheard blasphemous practice in the 50's. But his intentions weren't to instigate. He was simply practicing the only way he knew of getting close to God!<br /><br />It is hard to capture such an eventful life as that of ███, and that is perhaps where the movie fails. We are never really allowed to get close to ███ as a person. We know him only as much as we see him. His relationships, especially with ██████ █████████(██████ ████), aren't explored in detail. And the script barely passes over █████ ███(█████ ██████████), ███'s wife, who everyone knows was a rock by his side. And the biggest blunder of all is the rushed, almost abrupt climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized he was out of stock and called for a pack-up! Nonetheless, '███' is definitely recommended for a flawless performance from █████ ████ and an able stellar ensemble. The songs and age create a sense of nostalgia, and we get a genuine feeling that the film is made with sincerity. <br /><br />- ████████ ████████<br /><br />Note- '███' is nominated in six categories at this year's ███████ ██████, including ████ ███████, ████ ████████ and ████ █████(█████ ████).<br /><br />Rating- ***<br /><br />* Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent<br /><br />19th February, 2005
