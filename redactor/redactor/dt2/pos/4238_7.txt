This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a ████ ██████ movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought ████████ █████ played ███████ really well and ████ ██████ in ██████'s shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with █████████ █████ and ████ ██████'s scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day. But ██████ and ███████ were great to watch and I really liked the black humor to it. I thought it made the movie stand out more. If you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out.<br /><br />7/10.
