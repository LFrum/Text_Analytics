The way i found out about this movie was when i watched American pie 2, at the start it had a trailer for ███ █ indahouse, i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the DVD, it looked incredibly funny! so the next day, i went to my local store and picked it up for £3.99 (███████!). The film is about ███ █, who is a "gangster" of the west staines massive crew, who's rivals are the east staines massive crew. ███ has a "███ █████" pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the "ghetto" by teaching them how to swear and steal cars, after ███ finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the leisure centre where ███ teaches the kids, he runs for MP for staines and overthrows another MP in his attempts to get rid of the leisure centre to make room for an airport in staines. Throughout the film there are laughs aplenty as ███ gets up to some crazy stuff! Borat makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too, this is a definite must watch film for all you █████ █████ █████ fans out there!
