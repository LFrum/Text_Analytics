If you go into the █████ ██████ looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience you will be disappointed. This is not to say it is bad, but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie, running in a similar vein to ███████ ██████ and ████ ██ ██████. It's resolutely silly and juvenile, so if you want a good bit of serious Hong Kong action, look to a ████ ███ or ████ ███ Ping movie. This movie's got a lot of flak for it's silliness and I thought the first thing I should do would be to explain what you're getting into, as it's disappointed a lot of purists.<br /><br />For the non-purists and those with more forgiving tastes though, █████ ██████ is a delightfully silly kung-fu comedy. I liked it a lot for a variety of reasons, not least it's wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act. I believe this is the first movie of it's type they've been in, but they hop, kick and fly about like seasoned pros.<br /><br />The patently ridiculous plot is handled with a great deal of care and attention, and the movie is quite knowingly written, making a lot of the movie laugh out loud. The comedy really is the most prominent thing here, and it's a subtle, gentle comedy as reliant on words as inanimate objects going flying a la ███████ ████. It has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too. The sequence with the disco-dancing vampires is a total classic.<br /><br />The action is a blend of two genres really. It falls between the 'period drama' wire-and-sword fighting (which comes in more toward the end) and the comedy fighting style of ██████ ████, coming out with a blend that though a little derivative at times is always exciting to watch and occasionally throws up some genuinely innovative encounters.<br /><br />All this is great, and the movie is tremendous fun all the way through. Despite this, it does have a few sticking points. For instance, █████ ██████ is in many ways much more westernised than kung-fu fans are perhaps used to, the inevitable comparison to the █████ series is definitely sound as an example, though █████ ██████ is honestly much better than █████ ever managed, especially for fighting action. Personally, it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent ███████ ████ (the hissable villain from ████ ███'s classic ████ ██████) so underused, but the younger audience this is aimed at are unlikely to notice this or indeed know about ████ ██████ or his other movies, so this is only really a personal gripe.<br /><br />If you watch this with an open mind, you'll probably enjoy it greatly like I did, but you must be firmly aware it is a COMEDY, not a balls to the wall kung-fu movie. Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.
