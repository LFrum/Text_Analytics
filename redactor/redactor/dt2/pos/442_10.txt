This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties. It's the story of how █████ ████████ built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway, and the training of the dancers. Finally, the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.<br /><br />█████ is in great form as the easy-going ████████--see him deal humorously with ████'s violent boyfriend. ██████ Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting ████. █████ Felix, with that amazon's body, is imposing as the egotistical ████, ████████'s first lover. Finally █████████ ██████ as ████ the washing girl who ends up dancing for ████████, and becoming his girl, is just stunning; her loveliness and pert charm will win you over.<br /><br />A bonus: we get █████ ████, ████████, █████ ███████ and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the Moulin rouge.
