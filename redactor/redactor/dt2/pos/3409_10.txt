"North & South" the television mini-series is to the 80's what "████ ███, ████ ███" (the first-ever TV mini-series) was to the 70's.<br /><br />It's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy from author ████ █████. The story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of the election of President ███████ ███████ and the imminent proclamation of the Civil War - North versus South. The intertwining stories evolve around the families of the Hazards (the 'North' in the title) and the Mains and their two central figures of ██████ and ████ who form a friendship whilst embarking on their West Point training in 1842.<br /><br />"North & South" is a wonderful historic timeline and as I have grown older (and wiser!) it very much interests me to learn about the contrasting attitudes to such controversial aspects as 'Slavery' and 'Abolitionists', and how these attitudes originated.<br /><br />The series also portrays some great characterisation development as we get to know about the friends and enemies in ██████ and ████'s lives, and also the women that stole their hearts as young men. This aspect of the story also uncovers a romantic tale that is set to the turbulent backdrop of the American Civil War.<br /><br />"North & South", along with "████ ███, ████ ███" is overshadowed by 1977's "Roots" as the greatest mini-series of all-time. However, it does come a close second/third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as "Roots". But, don't let this one get away, even if it's just to see the great scenery, costumes, and brilliant all-star cast including ████ █████, ██████ ████, █████████ ██████, █████ ███████, ██████ ██ █████████, Lesley-Anne Down et al. <br /><br />The series is beautifully crafted and is firmly tied to actual historic events and it's a pity the Emmys and ██████ ██████ didn't honour a lot more of the actors and actresses for their portrayals. ███████ Swayze and █████ ████, the two virtual unknown lead actors at the time, turn in compelling performances as ████ ████ and ██████ ██████ respectively. However, it's ███████ █████'s riveting performance as ██████'s 'Abolitionist' sister Virgilia that steals the show many times. Plus, █████ ██████, █████ █████████ and ██████ ███████ as ███████ ████ are the delicious villains of the piece you just love to hate.<br /><br />"North & South" Books 1 & 2 are now available on two DVD sets.
