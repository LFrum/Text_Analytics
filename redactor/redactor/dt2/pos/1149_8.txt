In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the Moroccan leader █████ ██████ ████████ el-███████ the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American ████ Pedecaris (Candice ██████), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (████ █████). In times of election, the American President Theodore Roosevelt (█████ █████) agrees with the proposal. However, ███████ is betrayed and ████ helps him to be released from the prison with the American soldiers. I do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect to the sovereignty of other countries, but `The Lion and the Wind' is indeed a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice ██████, the most beautiful American actress in the 70´s, is wonderful, performing an abducted woman like in the remarkable movie `Soldier ████'. Sean Connery is perfect, as usual, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. █████ █████ is great as the American president. I do not know much about the Morocco history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. In Brazil it is only available on VHS. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `O Vento e o ████' (`The Lion and the Wind')<br /><br />
