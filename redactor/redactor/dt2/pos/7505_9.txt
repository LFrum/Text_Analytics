Being a retired medical/health field "toiler in the vinyard" I never get tired of seeing this film. █████ █████████ was a friend of my college comp teacher & visited him & us during several clases back in 1958. His writing ability has stood the test of time & the "Hospital" is as fresh as it was in 1971. I can watch it every week & still find something new. So many of the supporting cast members went unto bigger & better roles in both TV & film. ██████ █████ made only a few comedies, but his timing & patter are as good as ██████ ███████ & █████ ██████. Mental humour rather than physcial/slapstick wins in my book every time. And still a family film with only 1, four letter word during entire film
