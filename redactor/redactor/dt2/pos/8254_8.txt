I provided location services on the this film every Sunday we would shoot in London's ████████ ██████. █████ █████ ever the gentleman thoroughly enjoyed the role, sadly to be his last. we had a moment of panic when a trunk load of fake Krugerrands (cast for the film..) tipped down a storm drain. <br /><br />Imagine frantic crew opening all the drains to recover every last one. If you know and love London you'll love this comedy romp - also starts ███████ ██████ who sadly died from a brain tumour. A good film, great crew ,superb cast. look for the current stars of coronation street then playing crowd scenes or extras.The car lot and ████'s retail enterprises were all shot in west London, Chiswick the entire shopping parade and the American used car lot were dressed overnight, the car lot is still there as are the shops. A restaurant was suddenly turned into a funeral parlour. If you see the film on the listings make an effort to see it! By the way █████ ████████ the Bank receptionist was married to the production designer ████ Curtis..<br /><br />April 2007 Just thought I would add a few extra comments on locations:<br /><br />Pub: just off ████████ ██████ ████ ███████ ███████: in back Road alongide ██████████ ████ ███████ █████ Used ███ ███: along ████████ ████ ██████ and all shop locations near roundabout.

Computer room ██████████ near ███████ █████████ - Chiswick - █████ just outside the boundary on common land Bank interiors, ceiling void and strongroom :Twickenham studios<br /><br />And just to add █████ █████ ever the gentleman, joked and mixed with the crew, extras and so on......Niven would dine in the Connaught hotel bu join the crew for coffee!
