Moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy.<br /><br />One of "██████ v. ██████'s" great strengths is its screenwriter director ██████ ██████, who has marvellously adapted █████ ██████'s novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with "Places in the Heart", where he showed, as in "██████ v. ██████", that he has a natural ability for working with children.<br /><br />The picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine ███████ █████ nominations, two of them walking away winners. One of those was ██████ ███████ (Best Actor), who is superb as frustrated business man ███ ██████, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As said wife ██████, █████ ██████ claimed the supporting actress █████ for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Also nominated was ████ █████████ for her fantastic turn as the ██████'s good friend ████████. Final word in the acting stakes must go to young ██████ █████, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved █████ nomination came his way.<br /><br />Brilliant also is ██████ █████████' cinematography and █████ █████████'s timely editing, while musically █████ ███████'s classical piece is used to effect.<br /><br />Truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why ██████ had to go.<br /><br />Certainly if nothing else, "██████ v. ██████" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself.<br /><br />Saturday, June 10, 1995 - T.V.<br /><br />Strong drama from █████ ██████'s novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. Aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from ██████ ██████, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner.<br /><br />Hoffman is brilliant as ███ ██████, the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep. Excellent too is ██████ as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. In support of these two is a very strong ████ █████████ as mutual friend ████████, an outstanding ██████ █████ as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras.<br /><br />This highly emotional, heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 ███████ ██████ for best film, best actor (Hoffman) and best supporting actress (██████).<br /><br />Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - T.V.
