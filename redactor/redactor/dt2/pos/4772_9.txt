SPOILERS <br /><br />As you may know, I have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in the past months. Now, I have no idea why I am commenting on █████████ ██████, I guess I was just desperate to comment on anything, so I watched this, and now I am commenting on it. This, or course, is one of the very first cartoons, and I believe it is not the first cartoon with sound. <br /><br />Here is the plot. ██████ █████ is driving a steamboat when ████ throws him off and he drives it. When they stop for cargo ██████ █████ tried to get on but failed miserably. ██████ gets her up by a crane. Then a goat eats her sheet of paper with Turkey in the █████ on it. They use the goat to make the song. When I say that I mean that they used the goat as a Victrola. ██████ plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song. Then an angry ████ throws ██████ in a potato room and ██████ is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day.<br /><br />Overall, this is yet another groundbreaking silent short film. I mean, this is the third ██████ █████ cartoon. Yes, the third. Also, this is not the first cartoon with sound. I believe there were two more before this one. Either way, this film is really, really groundbreaking. ██████ was also more violent than he is mow. I mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it. <br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Recommended Films: █████ █████.
