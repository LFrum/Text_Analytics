For those too young to remember, or too old to have been part of the "hype", the ███████ ███████ fad in the early-to-mid 80's was at a fever pitch- like the hype about ███████, except this just didn't let up. Every song, every video, every word uttered by ███████ was important. Nothing similar had been seen since the heyday of the ███████.<br /><br />I remember seeing this video for the first time, at a roller skating rink. Everyone stopped skating. There was no question as to whether you were a ███████ ███████ fan or not; you were. Everyone crowded around the projection screen, and watched the video...<br /><br />This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made, and definitely the best. It perpetually gets #2 on the annual MTV top 100 videos (#1 is always the flavor-of-the-month, and somehow whatever was #1 of all time slips past #2, to make way for the new #1. Go figure.), and ████████ became a phenomenon in and of itself.<br /><br />If you ever get the chance, you must watch the video; not just the excerpts shown on MTV or VH1. If necessary, you should search out Making of ████████ at a video rental store. Hey... your parents probably made you watch ███████ and Woodstock footage because "it was important"... well, this is important too.
