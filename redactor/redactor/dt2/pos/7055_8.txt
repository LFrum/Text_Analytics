███████ head counselor ███████ ████████ (████ ██████ in peak nutty form in his first lead role) presides over the various wacky hi-jinks at North Star summercamp. ███████ befriends sad and lonely misfit kid ████ (a nice and affecting performance by █████ █████████). ████████ ████ ███████ relates the amusingly off the wall comic vignettes at a ceaseless snappy pace and maintains an engagingly good-natured tone throughout. This film astutely nails the breezy'n'breezy essence of summer: making friends, first love, pulling pranks, competing in sports with a rival camp, campfire singalongs, and, of course, the inevitable scary urban legend about the escaped psycho killer with the hook hand. The sense of gleefully raucous fun this picture generates is positively infectious. Moreover, the humor is always goofy and occasionally gross, but never too nasty or mean-spirited. Best of all, there's a winning surplus of pure heart to go along with said humor (the warm relationship between ███████ and ████ in particular is genuinely touching). The cast have an obvious ball playing their likable characters: ██████'s gloriously gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things constantly humming (his crazy PA announcements are absolutely sidesplitting), plus there are sound contributions from ██████ █████ as hapless camp owner █████, Kate Lynch as ███████'s sassy old flame ███████, ████ ██████ as the amiable Crockett, ████████ ██████ as the sweet, foxy A.L., █████ ██████ as the feisty Candace, ████ ████ as klutzy bespectacled nerd Spaz, █████ ██████ as tubby slob █████ ███████████, █████ ███████ as the fetching █████, and ████ ██████ as the hip ████████. ██████ ██████'s cinematography gives the movie an attractive sunny look and makes nifty use of wipes. █████ █████████'s lively and melodic score likewise does the trick. A real riot.
