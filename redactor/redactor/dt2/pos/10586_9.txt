Set in ███ ███████'s hometown of Westchester PA, ████████' is a semi-true story about the life of ████ ████ and his buddies ███████ and █████.<br /><br />████ has been dumped by his girlfriend of 2 years, ███████, who is now seeing a beer swilling, long haired metal head named '███████' and this is driving ████ insane with jealousy.<br /><br />In a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is going on between ███████ and ███████, ████ pays his friends █████ and ███████ to break into her house and produce evidence of the affair, with somewhat disastrous results for all concerned! I found this movie very funny, maybe partly because I am a total Jackass and CKY fan, and it has to be said that a lot of the humour will probably be lost on those that do not have prior knowledge of ███████ insane brand of 'comedy'.<br /><br />The movie contains much that will be of interest to skaters, not least the cameo appearance of skateboarding legend, ████ ████ as a police officer. There are also cameo's from █████ █████, ███████ █████, █████ █████, and ███'s long suffering parents, █████ and Phil.<br /><br />The DVD extra's include music video's from CKY (featuring ███'s ███████ ████ on drums), and ███'s favourite band, HIM (███'s character in the movie takes his name from HIM frontman █████ █████) There is also a documentary and a "too hot for jackass" skit.<br /><br />In summary, as I said before, this movie will mainly be of interest to skaters and Jackass/CKY fans, but I do feel that ███████ and co have made a great effort with ████████' and I for one, thoroughly enjoyed it.
