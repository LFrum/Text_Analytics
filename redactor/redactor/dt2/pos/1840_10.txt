██████ (Minnie Driver), a woman in her late twenties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. ███ (█████ ████████) has just had the tragedy of losing his wife in an automobile accident. One can guess the outcome. ██████ receives ███'s wife's heart, although they have no knowledge of each other....yet! A year later, ██████ is feeling like a new person while ███ is just beginning to think about his social life. When a friend sets him up on a blind date, ███ finds himself interested in the waitress, ██████, at the restaurant where the date occurs. They begin to see each other. How long will it be before the truth materializes and what will be the consequences? This lovely, funny, and touching movie is one of the best romantic comedies ever constructed. The two stars dazzle as the couple only heaven could bring together and the supporting cast, of ██████ ████, ███ ███████, and ███████ ████████, are just marvelous as well. Taking place near Chicago, the neighborhood setting is likewise charming and beautiful. Let's make that dittos for the costumes and script. If you know someone who goes ga-ga over mirthful love stories, you will be in their good graces forever if you introduce him or her to this fine movie.
