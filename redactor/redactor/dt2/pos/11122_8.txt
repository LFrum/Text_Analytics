Fame is one of the best movies I've seen about The Performing Arts. The music and the acting are excellent. The screenplay and ███ ██████ are also excellent. My favorite part is when all the students start ███████ and making music in the Canteen. I can see this movie any number of times, and never get bored. I give it 8 1/2 on 10.
