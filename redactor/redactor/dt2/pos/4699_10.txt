I have some great memories watching "█████ of Sherwood" on TV as a kid (but I think I only saw ███████ █████´s episodes, by some reason). And recently my brother bought the new released DVD-boxes of the complete series. It was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the █████ ████ movies and TV-series. The cast is great, and the locations mixed with Clannad´s music adds this very special feeling. I personally think that █████ is the best of the two █████s, but █████ ███████ was a great choice to continue the series with. ███ ████████, ███████ █████ and ██████ █████ is terrific in their roles as ████ ███████, The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne. It´s a pity that a fourth season never got made, and I´ve also heard that the writer ███████ █████████ actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series. ██████ of Huntingdon (Connery) could finally have married Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne the Hunter could resurrect █████ of Loxley (█████), and he could take his revenge against the sheriff. As have been mentioned before; if the producers of "█████ ████: The Prince of Thieves" would have been smart, they would have got the cast from "█████ of Sherwood", and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series. As ███ ████████ puts it in the DVD bonusmaterial, it would have been great to see them as old men, just like in Sean Connery´s "█████ and Marian". Who knows, maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. In any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!
