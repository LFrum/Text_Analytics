I adore this film. The chemistry between the two leads ██████ and ████████ is amazing, they spark so well off of each other, creating an unlikely comedy Duo. ████ Cumming is hilarious, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps it up. The acting is superb and it is a genuinely amusing and touching film. Not the greatest film ever made, I'll admit, but it is a huge amount of fun, and I would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty Brit flicks. Includes some of the best British actors, including ███████ ██████ so you can't go far wrong. Look out for cameos from █████ ████████ and ████ █████ of Little Britain and ████: Profile fame.
