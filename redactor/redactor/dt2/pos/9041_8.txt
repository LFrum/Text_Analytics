No movie could ever do justice to ████████'s command of the English language. but they did a pretty good job here. █████ █████████ is exactly the way I pictured him in the book, as is Chick. What the movie couldn't really go into was how █████████ wasn't liked by the Negro people either, because he was equally as stubborn. Not that it is a bad thing, but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world (yet, I got the feeling it was white society's racism that started it and it spilled over into Negro society, until that became his attitude toward everyone).<br /><br />the best part of the movie is that you get to see Yoknapatawpha county (actually, Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as ████████ wrote about it (the film was made when ████████ was alive and writing). It doesn't look that much different today. Because of this alone, the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in ████████'s backyard. A true must see for ████████ fans.
