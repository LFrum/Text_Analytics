CAUTION: SPOILERS<br /><br />Although this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience. I have not read ██████ ████'s book, but I am certain that ████████'s visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice. <br /><br />The study of ██████ von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between ██████ and ██████ when ██████ describes █████ as being both mathematical--i.e. quantifiable--and emotional. This conflict arises again in the scene where young ██████ is alone playing `Fuer █████' in lobby of the Hotel and ██████ recalls his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song. In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, ██████ is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions. This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that ██████ represents.<br /><br />Ultimately, ██████ is forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations? Or flee Venice to save his own life? His early attempt to flee Venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging his stay.<br /><br />Complimenting the captivating character interaction, ████████'s powerful scenery (especially of Venice at Dawn and the final scene of ██████ walking into the water and pointing to the horizon) renders this film a true masterpiece.
