This trash version of `Romeo and ██████' passes in Manhattan in the present days. Romeo (████ ██████) is an a**hole and violent member of family ███, and ██████ (████ ██████) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and breasts) and bisexual girl of Capulet family. The scatological situations this romantic pair will face are very funny. Although being a cult movie (inclusive exhibited in Rio de ███████ ████████), it is not recommended for all the audiences. If the viewer is fan of █████ ███████'s former movies (`Braindead', `Bad █████'), `Toxic ███████', `Body ████' and other trash movie, he will certainly love this flick. Otherwise, he will hate it. Since I belong to the first group, my vote is eight.<br /><br />
