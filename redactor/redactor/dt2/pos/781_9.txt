I saw this tonight with moderate expectations - if ██████ █████ have picked up on something and are releasing it the that's generally a good sign, however I'm not normally a fan of █████ ███████, generally disliking her comedy roles (sorry to any fans, but it's a personal thing - I just don't find her funny in comedy).<br /><br />This was magnificent though - a great performance by all, but █████ and Walters are exceptional! Plenty of laughs, plenty of pathos, great timing and a wonderfully paced film - such a coming of age film wouldn't normally be something I'd expect to like so much but I can't recommend this highly enough - and watch ██████ █████ as he matures into a fine fine actor.
