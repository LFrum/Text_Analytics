Im a die hard ████ ████ fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. <br /><br />The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, ███ and the hour, █████ within the gates, ██████ ██████ and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain ██████ was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).<br /><br />It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training. All in all, its a great film for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /><br />Two draw backs. One is the Germans bogus dodgy accents (come one, Germans cant pronounced the letter "W" like us) and Two The casting of ███ Frazer instead of the familiar █████ █████. I like ███ in other films like the carry ons but she doesn't carry it correctly in this and █████ █████ would have been the better choice.
