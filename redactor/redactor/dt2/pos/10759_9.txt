this is an adaptation of a Dirk Wittenborn book, which I did not read. young ████ ████ lives with his Mom ███ (█████ ████) in a cramped lower ████ ████ ███ ████ █████████. he dreams of joining his Anthropologist father studying a fierce tribe in South America. ███ has boyfriends and does coke. when he is caught scoring coke for her, one of her customers (███ is a legitimate masseuse) a rich ███ ███████ bails her out in return for being his full time personal masseuse in his huge estate in New Jersey. They are driven there in a limo with her strung out lying in the back seat with her dress hitched way up and panties showing. (this and a few low-cut dress scenes is the only exploitation of Ms. ████. some may be disappointed but I'm sorry she had to do all that stuff in "Unfaithful" to make the A-List. That lady has more talent in her little finger than ██████, ███████, and █████ █████ do in their entire BODIES and its time she was given her due.) when they arrive ████ makes friends with ████████ grandson █████, and has a coming of age with his new girlfriend, granddaughter Maya. ███ meanwhile joins AA and dates an AA doctor. She miraculously cleans up instantly. ████ however does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends. █████ seems like an OK guy but gets jealous when ███████ takes ████ on a hot air balloon race instead of him, and this leads to tragedy.<br /><br />the genius of the story, (and movie) is that they cut from the violent acts of the Fierce filthy rich Blysdale tribe to the Yanomano warriors. It's a little implausible though that when ███ finds out what happens to her son she merely demands action from ███████ and does not either contact the authorities or settle it Thelma and ██████ style. there are elements of a Gothic Romance with a revelation by the village idiot. Also they do almost no plot or character development prior to the move to Blysdale. ███, for instance, like ████'s █████ ██████████ in "Walk on the Moon" had an unwanted pregnancy with ████ at 18 and felt trapped. This is in the book but not the movie. Still, these are minor shortcomings. The movie will be in full release 12/31/05 over a year after the original release date, and I just couldn't wait.<br /><br />There were lots of Red Carpet moments in the theater I saw the movie at, with almost the whole cast...except █████ ████!! $#%#Q$ Director █████ said she was off filming a movie. I know she didn't promise to be there, but I came from way out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her in person. The movie is a definite Best Picture contender, as for acting?? Sutherland was quite good, and so was the boy who played ████. ████ was magnificent as always, but I only recall one or two emotional scenes, when she catches ████ with drugs "lets get f****d up together mother and son" and with ███████ "your twisted grandson...". She would fare better with a supporting actress nod but it wont work that way. unless they give it to her for a "body of work."
