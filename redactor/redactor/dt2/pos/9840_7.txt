"The Mayor Of Hell" has the feel of an early Dead End Kids film, but with a much harder edge and very few light spots, preceding the first appearance of the Dead Enders by four years. █████ ██████ has a full screen opening credit, even though technically, the 'mayor' of the movie's title is actually portrayed by ███████ █████, one of several boys sent to reform school during the opening scenes. █████'s character is █████ █████, a young tough who's befriended by 'Patsy' ██████ (██████), and is elected to the position when ██████ takes a chance at humanizing conditions at a state reformatory.<br /><br />Warner Brothers made a lot of these types of films, attempting to provide a conscience of sorts in an era that only too well knew about the effects of crime and poverty. This movie is quite gritty, with no apologies for ethnic stereotyping, as in the submissive posture of a black father in court or the way a Jewish kid gets to run a candy shop in the reform school. The rules at the reformatory are simple enough - work hard and keep your mouth shut; step out of line and you answer personally to ██████ ████████ (██████ ██████).<br /><br />██████'s role in the story seems somewhat ambiguous, since even though he makes a serious effort to improve conditions inside the reformatory, on the outside he's still nominally in control of a criminal racket. The film's attempt to juggle this dichotomy falls short in my estimation, the finale attempts to wrap things up in a neat package as ██████ awaits the outcome of a near fatal shooting of one of his henchmen. Not exactly the kind of role modeling one would look for in a film like this.<br /><br />Warner Brothers would sanitize some of the elements of this story in a 1938 remake titled "Crime School", featuring ████████ ██████ in the ██████ role, and █████ █████ in the ███████ █████ part. If you're partial to the Dead End Kids you'll probably like the latter film better, since it also offers familiar faces like ███ ██████, █████ ████, █████ ██████ and ███████ ████. However the ending is somewhat muddied in that one too, with ██████'s warden character involved in a cover up of a prison breakout. Both films offer a romantic interest for the lead characters, in 'Mayor', █████ █████ is a reform minded nurse that falls for ██████'s character.<br /><br />Curiously, a lot of █████ ██████'s early films aren't commercially available, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for a screening on Turner Classics, or source the film from a private collector. Personally, I can't get enough of this kind of stuff, and find intriguing points of interest in the films of all genres from the Thirties and Forties.
