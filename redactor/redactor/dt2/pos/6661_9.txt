In Cold ████████, North Colorado, near to the period of the American Civil War, the Reverend Monroe (██████ ██████████) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy ███ ██████ (██████ ██████), due to health reasons. ███ meets the also shy █████ (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. With the beginning of the war, █████ becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see ███ in Cold ████████ again. Meanwhile, ███ meets ████ ██████ (█████ █████████), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance. I liked this film a lot. Having names such as ██████ ███████ ███████, ███████ ███████ and ████████ ██████ in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of ███████ █████████ and seven indications to the Oscar, this movie does not disappoint. My remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, which show what happens with ████, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Cold ████████'
