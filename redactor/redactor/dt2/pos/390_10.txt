███ ██████'s lyrical ██████████ boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering (beautifully photographed by █████ █████) that is more vibe than narrative. Caught somewhere between documentary and dream, ██████████ recalls the inventiveness of early ████ ██████ and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van ████. With grit, glamour and heartbreak, it's kinda like the movie equivalent of █████ █████ playing bubblegum pop.
