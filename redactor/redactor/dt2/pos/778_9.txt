I caught the first screening of ███████ ███████ at the Tribeca Film Festival. ██████ █████ shows he can act past █████ ██████. █████ ██████ is amazing as the overbearing mother. █████ Walters is hilarious as ████ ████ ██████, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about ███████ ███████, but life lessons. Ben (██████ █████) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life. It's an amazing film, from an amazing director whose taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see, and everyone who can, should.
