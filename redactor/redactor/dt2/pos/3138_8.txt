It takes a while to get adjusted to the sound of Sons of The Pioneers , but then you thoroughly enjoy it. If the soundtrack would be played by an orchestra like ███ ███████ or ██████ ███████ it would lose its folkloric character. The music conducts the film, everything seems to follow its rhythm. The whole cast is excellent. ███ ███████ and █████ █████ Jr. are the young men guiding the caravan. ████ Bond is the Mormon leader and ██████ ███ is a flirting actress. Ford was able to make of what would be an ordinary western, something totally different and original showing us the music, the dances, and most of all, the people.
