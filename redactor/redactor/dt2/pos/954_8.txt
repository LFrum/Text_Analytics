Ghillie a remake of the Telugu "okkadu' is thankfully a clarified version of the original. It packs the same punch and ███████ true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache. A flagging █████'s career with the entry of the likes of Surya and ██████ on the fray, got the much needed uplift with this movie. This might well prove to be the best movie █████ has ever been on, considering the choices he has been making since then. The hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alike.<br /><br />The tightly snug script, which runs at, a neck-break speed revolves around Velu, a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of Kabaddi( a popular game among boys in India). The events following the chance encounter with ██████████, his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie. █████ fits as a 'T' into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door.<br /><br />██████ has more than a stereotyped Tamil heroine mantle to play. The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. With limited dialog's, ██████ exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a cover page girl coming-of-age to become a professional actress. ██████ became my personal favorite after this movie.<br /><br />The movie ends on predictable lines, although one has to credit the Director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including ██████'s change in decision to leave the country. ███████ Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter-weight for █████'s role. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero's armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing.<br /><br />Overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing. I give it a clear 8 out of 10.
