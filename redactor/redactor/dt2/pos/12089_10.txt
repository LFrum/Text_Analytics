I have been away from ████████ for the last 10 years. During that time I constantly lived in London. When I have seen the movie I realised how much I am ██████████. I am not just from Turkey I am a part of Turkey. One of my part is ████████, the sound of the ████████, the people of the ████████.<br /><br />Probably Faith ████ thought that he has done great musical documentary but I must say it is more than that. It is about putting nice blend of vastly different musics, cultures, approaches, politics, ethnics into a delicious pot...<br /><br />As we all know Turkey to be precise ████████ is always comes and goes between being eastern or western city. As one of the band member said ████████ is a bi-cultural city. But much more a eastern city because we always tried to be a western city. It shows we've never been one.<br /><br />This movie will catch from very first second. Music is excellent, people are fascinating. Especially █████ and █████ ████. Singers, band members! It is nice to see you all at a small cinema in Wood Green.
