I was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves (just view those votes). Not top-class action like "███ ████" or "██████ ██████", but still something like a solid 7 out of 10: fine script, good actors with working chemistry, and a director who knows what he wants (sadly, this was director ██████'s last good film. "Deep ████ ███" managed to reach 'an OK rollercoaster-ride'- status, but "█████████ ██████, and especially, "Driven" are well-deserved flops!) Personally I think the turn-off at the box-office might have been the "Woman as an action star"-theme. Well, give her a chance, because █████ does deliver a performance above par. And, after all, this film doesn't concentrate so much on the "feminine"-side, but instead on good ol' action, buddyism (███████ as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here, plus his share of action- and about a thousand killer wisecracks!) and on the plot (from █████ █████, the writer of "██████ ██████" and "The Last Boy Scout". The latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this one...the theme, the clever plot, also as good and as underrated!) Overall: if one hasn't seen this one yet, don't forget to rent it for the next quiet Saturday night!
