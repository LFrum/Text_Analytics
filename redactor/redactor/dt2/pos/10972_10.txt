MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. You know that the characters after finding out that the so-called "Gift From God" was actually a loan, will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end, but how they get there is not as obvious. The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going. The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip. █████ ███████, ███████ █████, and ██████ ████████ prove that they are capable of more than playing the Riddler, ██████ █████████, or ████'s friend ███████ while ████ ██████████ and ██████ ██████ play characters different than we have seen on their TV series. ██████ ██████'s portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church. If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a ███████ █████ rendition of "The Way You Look ███████"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.
