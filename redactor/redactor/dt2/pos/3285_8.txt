This was a pretty good episode. Though no "Trapped in the Closet" or "███████ ████," it had a lot of things going for it. The character of ██ ████ and that bizarre-as-hell "super cereal" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest ███████/████ moments ever. When ███████ is superstitious of ████ that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake!), and he comes within inches of his face. Suddenly, ████ wakes up, and they have that crazy conversation where ███████ tries to act like everything is completely fine. ███████ crapping out the treasure at the end, though predictable, was pretty funny.
