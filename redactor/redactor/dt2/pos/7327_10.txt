Yes, it's "Flipper". But writer/director ████ ███████ has put together a gem of a version. Spectacular above and underwater photography from "Jaws" veteran ████ ██████ and haunting music by ████ ███████ and Crosby, ██████ & Nash make this truly memorable family entertainment. Shapiro, whose last film was improbably "The Crush", shows himself once again to be an extremely talented -- and versatile -- filmmaker. Rent it!
