This is probably the second best of the █████ ████ movies. █████ ████ 5 is the best one.<br /><br />█████ ████ 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick "Gangs of New York" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in █████ ████ 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.<br /><br />███████ ██████, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence. So, like ████ ███████ in █████ ████ II, █████ ████ III scores with its gentle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. Only the █████ ████ love-interest scenes would do much better.<br /><br />And, in addition to his .38, ██████ plays with this new gun called the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the █████ █████ movies when ████████ used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, ██████ ██████ and █████ █████. The Wildey gun packs a big punch and when ██████ kills with it, he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it.<br /><br />And that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader? Well, that is something. ██████ would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weapon....that is way too military for him.
