A European musician and composer sets out to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul. A lover of experimenting with sound, █████████ █████ (of the German avantgarde band ████████████ █████████) roams the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and "magic mike" to assemble an inspired portrait of Turkish music.
