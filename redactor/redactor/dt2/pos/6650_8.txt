I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, thought not quite so much as "The English Patient" (a modern-day classic). The first 20 minutes or so feel awkward, but as █████ (Jude ███) embarks on the journey back to his love Ava (██████ ██████), the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently it is fashionable to hate ██████ at the moment, but I don't agree at all, and she does well here. I actually think that the romance between █████ and ███ is weakly developed in the script (they really don;t get much screen time together to develop a relationship), but ███ and ██████ give it their all and convince. ███'s journey is the crux of the film- she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything. █████████ at first seems all wrong as ████, but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. ████ White, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker's complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented Irish actor in an early bit part, and ███████ ███████ actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence. It's a pity that in "The Other ██████ ████" she's so inadequate.
