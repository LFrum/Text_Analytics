Not all movies are █████ worthy but let's face it, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This one left me smiling and happy and I couldn't wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose one. I believe most people would identify with █████ almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth. █████ ██████ was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and ████ ██████ █████ was convincing as a good mother. The little boy who played █████ had a cherub face and his sister and friend █████ played terrific backup roles. Liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy. Thanks!
