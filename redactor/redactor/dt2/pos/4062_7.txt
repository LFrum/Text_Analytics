As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.<br /><br />Eddie ██████ and ██████ ██ ████ team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and ███████ played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as ████ █████ has.<br /><br />Moving along, this "buddy" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time. The movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video/dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out.<br /><br />Eddie ██████ is at his usual top-form and is downright enjoyable to watch. ██ ████ has molded into this type of role perfectly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy Showtime.<br /><br />Top Performance: ██████. Hilarious. ██████ said. Directing ███: Nice. Nice action scenes, used ██████ and ██ ████ together like a charm, Russo fed off in a nice supporting job.<br /><br />My Rating: 7 out 10. It's not going to move you or anything...but it's an extremely enjoyable movie.<br /><br />It's Showtime...was a great success.
