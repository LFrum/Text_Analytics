We are taken to a convenience store where ████ is looking at coins in his hand figuring if he can get the special, a 69 cents 20 ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free pastry. He decides to go for the larger size, which of course is more expensive plus it doesn't qualify him for the cake. He tries to argue with the Indian clerk at the register, who keeps her ground. With her it's a matter of principle. Well, ████ gets irritated not getting his own way and proceeds to kill her. <br /><br />The tone of the story is set from the start. The people we are about to meet are not nice guys. There are ████, his girlfriend, ██████, and their partner █████ ████. They are drug dealers. ████ decides to visit █████, his friend, and former partner in crime, in Houston. He wants to do one more transaction and then go to Paris with the profits from selling the drugs he is bringing. What he doesn't realize is that █████ has gone straight. He is an architect, married to █████████, and wants to adopt a baby.<br /><br />█████ doesn't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house. He decides to get rid of the stuff by flushing them down the kitchen drain. The untimely arrival of Ice, a pizza delivery man, takes █████ by surprise. This man has been sent to kill him, but before that, █████ brings out some weed to share with Ice, who has a talent for rapping.<br /><br />It is at this point that Dr. ██████, the man from the adopting agency, arrives. █████'s application shows a two year gap that he can't justify. ██████ begins to doubt about the prospective father. At this time, ██████ makes an entrance. She is a woman that asks questions point blank, like when she demands to know whether ██████ enjoys watching porn. ██████, who is aroused ends up leaving in a huff. ██████ has decided to seduce █████ at all costs. There is a surprise in store as █████ ████ enters the picture and he doesn't like what he sees, shooting ██████ in the process. █████ ████ has also come to off █████, but he is overpowered.<br /><br />█████ gets the visit of ███████ who wants to get his money from ████; in his absence, he'll take it from █████. ███████ gives a deadline and █████ makes up his mind to outsmart all these low lives. He has all the parties come to his house at an appointed hour and the different factions will take care of themselves. In the end, █████ has a better plan that includes taking █████████ for a stay in Paris.<br /><br />Never having heard about "Thursday" we were drawn into it because of the talent in it. ████ █████ directed his own material. This seems to be a film with good intentions. At times the film remember others of the same genre, not a sin by any shape, or form, which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here in the IMDb site. For starters, "Thursday" shows a witty ████ █████ that has gone to write other films, notably, "Swordfish". The screenplay is divided in chapters with suggestive titles, pertaining to the action. █████ ██████ does wonders with the mostly interior photography. <br /><br />██████ ████ makes an excellent contribution to the film with his █████. Although hard to imagine, he has beat the odds and made something out of himself. This actor, seen recently in the television series "Hung", is one of the actors we don't tire of watching. A dark haired █████ ███████ is a welcome addition to any film. He is a greasy criminal that shows no redeeming qualities, or anything close to remorse and doesn't hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme. █████ LeGros has nothing to do. Same goes for ███████ █████████, a gorgeous creature that is only a distraction, or an afterthought to add a sexy angle. We enjoyed █████ ███████, who appears as Ice. He does a mean audition on the telephone. ███████ Jeter and ██████ ██████ also appear.
