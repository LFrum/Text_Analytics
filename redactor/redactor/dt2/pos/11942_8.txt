I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10. It had an excellent plot, and █████ ██████ and ███████ ███, as well as the rest of the cast, did their parts well.<br /><br />Both █████ and ███████ were too long in the tooth for the ages their characters were supposed to be, and their children in the film, obviously would have been better suited being their grandchildren.<br /><br />I missed the first ten minutes of this film, so I don't know just how that body turned up after 25 years and got traced back to █████ ███████ (█████ ██████'s character), but I had no difficulty picking up on the storyline.<br /><br />███████ ███████ (███████ ███) is stunned when her long-time husband, █████ is arrested for a murder in Oregon some 25 years previous, a state █████ claims he was never in.<br /><br />However, as evidence piles up against █████, his story changes. Then his story changes again and yet again, until ███████ doesn't know what to believe.<br /><br />███████ makes up her mind, however, to get to the bottom of the mystery whirling around the fateful time █████ and a young girl named ██████ accepted a ride from a stranger named █████ ███████, that ended in murder.<br /><br />I found the film entertaining, well paced, and it kept me guessing as to what had really happened between those three people.<br /><br />From what I saw during the closing credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.
