I will admit I possibly missed tiny moments when I wasn't paying proper attention, but I got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film, from director ██████ █████████, who played ███████ █████ in Chitty Chitty ████ ████. Basically it starts with a happy upper-middle class family living in Victorian London. One night the Father (Iain Cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, and he leaves with them, and does not return. They move to a cottage in the country, and here the children; Bobbie (█████ ███████, who I first saw in Child's Play 2), Phyllis (█████ ████████) and █████ (████ ██████) keep their spirits up, with their fascination for the nearby railroad. Everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes. Their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father. Also starring █████ ████████ as Mother/Mrs. Waterbury, ███████ ████████ as ██████ █████, ███████ ██████ as Old Gentleman, █████ ████████ as ██████ ███████, ███ █████████ as Ruth and ██████ ███████ as Russian. It was number 29 on The 100 Greatest ██████ █████, and it was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!
