My mother is as ████ With The Wind as one can be. She has the collector's plates, the █████ and ████████ ██████ █████████ dolls, GWTW Christmas ornaments, even a GWTW cookbook! My sister and I had only seen bits and pieces of GWTW but we knew the whole plot by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking my mother would like it and we had taken an interest in it after leafing through the novel a bit.<br /><br />Yesterday we decided to watch both ████ With The Wind and ████████. We started GWTW at about 2:30 in the afternoon and ended it at 6:30. We started ████████ right after. My mother usually goes to bed at about 10:00, she wound up staying up until 1:30 with us to finish it! We were riveted! I like how the movie starts off at Melanie's funeral, right where ████████ left off saying, "I'll think about it tomorrow." ████████ doesn't stay in Georgia for long, she runs off to Charleston in her quest to win him back. █████ is not happy when he finds ████████ in his home so he leaves for the family's plantation. ████████, being ████████, follows him and they finally agree to put aside their quarrels for a time in order to keep the gossip at bay. █████ starts to enjoy her company again and takes her out on his boat. A storm comes up and they sink. He helps her swim to the shore of some island. Terrified that she has died, █████ is anxious until she awakes. When she does they both get swept up in the moment and make love. ████████ wakes up the next day back in Charleston but █████ has gone and writes that he thinks it best if they never see each other again.<br /><br />████████ is heartbroken and when she is so she does some stupid things, in this case she is seen by ████ ███████ going up into a hotel room alone with ██████. Nothing happens, but her reputation is stained so ████████ goes to Savannah with her two spinster aunts. She soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell █████. While in Savannah she meets many of her O'Hara relatives and grows to like one cousin in particular a Father █████. She soon gets her divorce notice from █████ and then decides she will never tell him about her baby just to spite him. ███████ ████████.<br /><br />She decides to go to Ireland to make sure █████ can never discover her condition. She meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful ancestral home █████████. Through out this time, █████ is courting ████. It is on Halloween when ████████ gets the notice that █████ has remarried, she goes into labor that night.<br /><br />The movie skips to a year later and ████████ is very happy with her beautiful daughter ███. She is being pursued by ████ ███████ ██████ who is really an evil man, forcing a young girl named ████ █████ to sleep with him. ████████ meets █████ and ████ again at a horse fair. After a riding accident, ████████ has a conversation with ████ and learns that she and █████ are to have a baby. Heartbroken again, ████████ leaves and goes to Dublin with ██████. There she cultivates a relationship with him, like I said, she does stupid things when she is heartbroken.<br /><br />████ █████ has discovered she is pregnant and goes to █████ for help. The priest urges ██████ to help the girl and ██████ murders him after █████ threatens to tell ████████. ██████ convinces ████████ to go to London with him to escape her grief over █████'s death. ████ asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, ████ has died of ██████ █████. It is made clear that she never bore █████ a child.<br /><br />In London, ████████ sees ██████'s true colors after he hurts her when she isn't in the mood the sleep with him. ██████ rapes her after she tells him she never wants to see him again. She falls unconscious after and when she wakes up ██████ has been stabbed to death. ████████ is charged with his murder.<br /><br />█████ hears about it and rushes off to England with █████ in tow. Fearful of the gallows, ████████ has no choice but to tell █████ about their daughter. █████ is furious at her for keeping such a secret but stays to help her. ████ █████, the real killer, can't be found. ████████ is found guilty but ████ finally arrives to declare her innocence. After promising to help ████, ████████ leaves with █████ for Ireland because as he says, "It's time I became acquainted with my daughter." The scene where he sees ███ for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, █████ sees how much ████████ has changed and the two finally reconcile completely and admit they still love each other deeply.<br /><br />After seeing GWTW, I will say that yes, ██████ █████ was a better ████████, but I liked the character of ████████ in this film than in the first. The reason being that in GWTW, you don't know why you like ████████. She's so cruel to █████ and haughty and spoiled, but you like her lively spirit. In ████████, you see how much she has changed. Oh she is still in the lap of luxury, but she's not haughty anymore. You see how she becomes a true mother to ███ and a generous person to the poor people of Ireland. ██████ ███████ does and excellent job at playing this new side of ████████. ███████ ██████ is not █████ █████, but at times you swear that you can see original █████ in him.<br /><br />If you just sit back and not compare ██████ ███████ and ███████ ██████ with ██████ █████ and █████ █████, you will most certainly enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare the ████████ of yesterday, the one she becomes after "tomorrow".
