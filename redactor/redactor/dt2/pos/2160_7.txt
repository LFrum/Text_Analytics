█████ ██████ starts in '1968' as a young ████ ██████ (█████ ███████) is unexpectedly handed the family tradition of becoming a ███████ hunter when a fellow ███████ hunter ███ O'Mack (███ Haim) betrays his family & hands them over to the ███████'s, to aid ████ on his quest he is given a book that contains the name of every ███████ alive, or dead whichever way you look at it... Jump to 'June 1995' & Los Angeles where the now adult ██████ (███ 'The ██████' ██████, also credited as co-producer) has but four names left in the book including, Argento (Vince Murdocco) & Carmella (Sophia Crawford) together they are the last of the American ███████s. As they all dine in a restaurant ██████ crashes the party & kills them, job done right? Wrong as King of the ███████s Bruno Fischer (████████ █████) calls in the last four remaining ███████s from around the world, the French Tournier (█████ ████), the Asian Hashimoto (███ ████), Ulmer (█████ 'Shark Fralick) & Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to track ██████ down & kill him. Meanwhile █████████'s Hooper (██████ ████████) & Browning (Cash Casey) don't have a clue & a nosey reporter named █████ █████ (███████ █████) becomes involved in the battle between ██████ & the ███████'s on which the very fate of Earth rests!<br /><br />Directed by ████ ████████ I thought █████ ██████ was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes. The script by ███████ ██ ███████ mixes martial arts & horror with a fair degree of success, it moves along at a nice pace & is at least never boring & thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. The character names that reference other horror film director's/actors are a little tacky though. Some may be surprised at how closely █████ ██████ resembles █████ (1998) yet was made a couple of years prior, the lone moody long coat wearing ███████ hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts, the scene set in a nightclub & the innocent woman drawn into the world of ███████'s. █████ ██████ doesn't really stick to traditional ███████ film law, for instance sunlight only irritates their eye's, they can only breed on a solar eclipse (why?), stakes through the heart & garlic is no good as the way to kill a ███████ in █████ ██████ is to break it's neck. I could have done with a bit more horror & a bit more blood as it leans more towards the martial arts side of things. The dialogue is suitably cheesy & the character's are just about likable enough in a silly way.<br /><br />Director ████████ does his best to ruin the film, the actions scenes are OK but lack a certain something & for some bizarre reason whenever an action sequence takes place he shakes his camera constantly, it's like the camera is placed upon a washing machine full cycle! ███ Rick, mate, it's not clever or stylish it's irritating & annoying. The gore is disappointing with a few gory gunshot wounds & a few splashes of blood, breaking ███████'s necks don't involve much blood unfortunately.<br /><br />With a budget that probably didn't amount to much █████ ██████ is competently made throughout. The acting was bad most of the time & what's with 'The ██████' thing in ███ 'The ██████' ██████'s name? Has he legally changed his name? Does he sign cheques ███ 'The ██████' ██████?! Does he get mail addressed to him in that name? I think I might do something like this, from now on I want to be known as ████ 'The ██████ █████' Andrews...<br /><br />█████ ██████ is one of those crap films that transcends it's limitations & awfulness to become pure golden entertainment. If you like your films fun then █████ ██████ might be for you, if your looking for big-budget thrills in a similar vein (! ███████'s, veins & blood get it?) then █████ & it's sequels would probably be a better choice. What the hell, I liked it so sue me.
