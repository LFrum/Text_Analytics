If you put ████████ aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! Just Great!<br /><br />"The King Of Queens" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows ████ █████████ (█████ █████), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary ██████ █████████ (Leah ██████), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. <br /><br />████ and ██████ deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately carries them through each dilemma they face, whether it's ████'s fixation with food or ██████'s obsession with expensive clothing. <br /><br />████ and ██████ also have to deal with the third, high-maintenance member of the Heffernan household ­ ██████'s twice-widowed father, ██████ ███████ (█████ ███████), who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. ████ and ██████ have stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep ██████ happy ­ his regular excursions with gullible dog walker █████ (██████ ████████). ████'s friends ██████ ██████ (██████ ████████), ██████ ██████ (██████ ██████) and cousin █████ █████████ (████ █████████) round out the cast with their "guy" humor and diverse perspectives.<br /><br />In a manner that evokes "The Honeymooners," THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in life's everyday situations. Last season alone saw ████ "loaning" ██████ to a wifeless Deacon for help with Thanksgiving dinner; the Heffernans suffering through the annoyance and financial strain of mold damage to their house; and ████ and ██████ striving to copy a couple whose photos ­ of a more adventurous life than ████ and ██████'s ­ they accidentally took home. We also watched ██████ grow jealous of a new dog that █████ added to her route, and ████ finding out that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog Rocky three times behind his back. Throughout, the series showcases █████' incredible physical comedy, ██████'s hard-edged wit, and ███████'s unique comic presence.<br /><br />You can't... You shoulden't Miss it!
