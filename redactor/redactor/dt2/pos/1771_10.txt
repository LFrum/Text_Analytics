I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to ████ ██████ in Hollywood, and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This movie was directed by ███████ ████████, and besides ████ ██████ in the starring role. It also stars █████ ███████, █████ █████, and ███████ ████████. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. ████ ██████ was married to ██████ ██████. She also starred in "Viva ██████" with ██████ ██████, ███████ █████, who won an Oscar for playing the role ██████'s brother (██████ ██████ starred as ██████) (1952). And she also starred in "Captain from Castile" (1947) with █████ █████. Since then I've been trying to find a place where it is available, but so far I have not been successful. Does anybody have any suggestions about where I can find and purchase this movie? It this comment contains spoilers, I am unaware of it.
