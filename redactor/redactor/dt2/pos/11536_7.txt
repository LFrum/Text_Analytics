████████ Egan's novel was brought to the screen by Canadian director ████ ██████ in a film that, based on some comments from contributors to this forum, sounds a bad proposition, but in fact, it's much better than one is led to believe.<br /><br />This is a story about two sisters who loved one another dearly. █████, the fair headed and happy-go-lucky hippie girl, takes her younger sibling, ██████, under her wing. ██████ plainly loves █████; when the older one decides to follow her boyfriend ████ to Europe on a summer vacation from ███████, she promises she will send ██████ a post card every day. █████ does that, until the cards stop coming in and one night, some time later, the family receives a phone call to inform them █████ has died under tragic circumstances.<br /><br />██████ can't forget █████. That is why after some years pass by, she decides to take the same route the older sister took. She takes the cards from █████ and visits each place, starting in Amsterdam, then moving on to Paris and she wants to end up the trip in Portugal, where █████ encountered her untimely death.<br /><br />In Paris, ██████ hooks up with ████, who by now, is not a hippie anymore and is living with his girlfriend. ████, tries to persuade ██████ into abandoning her trip and to go back home; she suspects that ████ holds the key into solving the mystery, and as she is going to depart for Portugal she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts ████'s version he has told ██████. He feels guilty and, against his girlfriend's wishes, decides to accompany ██████ to the town where █████ died. The story changes at this point and we go back in flashbacks to what █████ experienced in Europe and what happened in her final days.<br /><br />The best thing in "The Invisible Circus" are the performances of the principals, something that ███ ██████ has to take the credit for. The big surprise is the range of ███████ ████, who, as █████, seems to select light comedy parts, when she is quite able to do good dramatic work under the right director. ███████ Brewster is seen as the older ██████ and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. She is a stunning beauty with what seems to be a naturalness for acting. ███████████ █████████ is ████ and shows he also is capable of doing more serious drama. The sweet ███████ █████ plays the younger ██████ quite convincingly. ██████ ██████ appears as the mother of the girls.<br /><br />The European locations are gloriously photographed by █████ ██████. The film is also enhanced by the musical score of ████ Laird-Clowes and █████ █████'s original song. █████████ Kling edited with great elegance. Ultimately, this film shows ████ ██████ in great form as he gives the right tone to the adaptation of the novel and gets rewarded by having the right cast doing wonders for him.
