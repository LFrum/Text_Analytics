█████ ██████, racketeer and political ward heeler, get to become a Deputy Commissioner of Corrections and visits a boys reform school. The catch is that ██████ is not in it for the graft, he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like their's.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is ██████ ██████ who is a grafting chiseler and a sanctimonious hypocrite to boot. One of the subtexts of the plot of The Mayor of ████ is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations. Note in the mess hall scene as ██████ offers a prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive, ██████ is eating well, but the kids are getting quality you wouldn't feed to your pet.<br /><br />██████ has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam. That puts ██████ back in charge and setting up the film for it's ██████ █<br /><br />The Mayor of ████ was a typical product from the working class studio. And because it was pre-Code it gets pretty gruesome at times. A later version of this, █████ ██████, with ████████ ██████ and the Dead End ████, was a more sanitized remake.<br /><br />Although ██████ is fine in the lead role as is █████ █████ the school nurse, the acting honors go to ██████ ██████. ████ to believe that the same man could portray the drunken, but kindly, one legged ship's surgeon in Mutiny on the Bounty. But ██████ is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in. <br /><br />This film is not shown to often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays. A whole lot of minorities would be offended today. Still it's a fine film.<br /><br />Interestingly enough a few years ago the film ████████ came out and it touched on some of the same issues. I guess films about reform schools don't change in any time.
