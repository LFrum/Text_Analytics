I really enjoyed this movie. It was edgy without being sociopath. ███ ██████ brought the Riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels.<br /><br />I also saw ████ █████ and ███ is perfect. (The snowmobile movie - oh yeah, it's called "Triple-X," or "xXx" - was a weak example of his work.) In █████ █████ he plays an anti-hero to the max. I don't think you can go wrong when ███ stars in a movie. Unfortunately, █████████ might type cast him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! I think the script for "XXX" was weak for which ███ couldn't act down to it.<br /><br />Anyway, █████ █████ is a great scifi - see it!<br /><br />-Zafoid
