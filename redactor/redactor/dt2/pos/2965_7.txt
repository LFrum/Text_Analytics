To sum this story up in a few sentences: A teenage girl (███) uses her hot body and "supposed" virginity to entice a young troubled guy (████) with a potential football scholarship to provide her a "Full Ride" out of town. Come to find out she has quite the reputation & has slept with many football players in the past hoping they would offer her the same deal. Both of these kids have come from troubled & dysfunctional homes. ████'s mothers a alcoholic who repeatedly embarrasses him in front of his friends & ███'s mother had a bad reputation herself & got pregnant with ███ at a a young age. ████ falls in love with ███ & tries to straighten out his life for her. Very predictable ending. The actress that plays "███" is actually 33 years old trying to play a teenager!
