If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick, complete with the huge in-theatre poster, depicting a near-naked Christina █████ chained to none other than ███ ███ ███ MF himself, ██████ ███████. But let me tell you, if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare, it's █████ ██████'s redemptive follow-up to Hustle & ████, █████ █████ Moan.<br /><br />Unashamedly over the top from the get go, this film sucks you in with the opening scenes and proceeds to dig deeper and deeper in with every subsequent frame. It's yer basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find in each other the strength and courage to move on, in more positive ways, with their lives. ████ done before, of course, this tale, but as I've always said, it's the manner in which a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power.<br /><br />█████'s damaged-by-childhood-abuse wild-child character ███ and ███████'s equally soulsick musician character ███arus find each other under desperate circumstances, and ███ takes it upon himself to try to help ███. This in itself is relatively unique: the idea of a man trying to genuinely help a woman who is in serious pain, rather than trying to take further advantage of her, and we know from the onset that ███'s heart, and the film's heart, is in the right place. The movie at its core is about the redemptive, healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates profoundly with this truth - soulfully, artfully and brilliantly.<br /><br />A major reason the film succeeds so profoundly is because of the fierce, committed performances from █████ and ███████. Scenes that would have come off as laughable and pathetic in lesser artists' hands are, instead, powerful as all get-out. In particular, the film's arc scene, in which ███████ sings and plays the song of the title alone in his house, with █████, amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons from ███'s past running amok inside her head, leading her to crawl to ███arus and cling to his leg, comes off not ridiculous as technically it should, but rather as gut-wrenchingly cathartic. <br /><br />All the supporting performances are fantastic here too. ██████ Timberlake is completely believable as ███'s anxiety-ridden boyfriend ██████, and the always-wonderful S. ██████ █████████ is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for ███arus. ████ ███████ ██ █ is outstanding as well, as ███'s reverend friend R.L. (a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside, no doubt). Everything works about this movie, let's face it, including the music/soundtrack, which features Burnside, █████ █████, █████ ████, ███ █████, and most importantly, ███████ himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I am listening to as I compose this review. There's also a really beautiful and moving version of "This Little Light of Mine" featured in the film, sung heart-breakingly tentative and soft by █████ █<br /><br />██████ ███████ has said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this movie is the best of his career thus far; I could not agree with him more. This is work that he can be monumentally proud of, along with everyone else involved in this audacious, supremely wise and deeply heartfelt mother*ucker of a project.
