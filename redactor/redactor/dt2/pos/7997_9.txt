So what is 'Batman ███████', anyway?<br /><br />It was marketed as an action film, and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film - but really, there isn't that much action, and ███ ██████ barely seems interested in it.<br /><br />People often align it with the 'grittier' superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read 'The ████ ██████ ███████', that seems just a little absurd; ██████'s excessive imaginings have more in common with the day-glo sixties TV series (the Penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck, for goodness' sake).<br /><br />██████'s style is often described as Gothic, and that's a little closer to what we see on screen; the Penguin - deformed, malign, with a tangled history and a subterranean lair - is a Gothic menace dressed up in more respectable Dickensian clothes - Udolfo masquerading as █████ ████. <br /><br />But what of Catwoman? She may be raised from the dead, but that PVC catsuit is decidedly █████████ ███████, and her alter ego ██████ ████'s world is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy.<br /><br />And then it clicks. The smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire? The ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise? 'Batman ███████' is, quite clearly, a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through ██████'s S&M dungeon sensibilities. It has more in common with 'The █████████ █████' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero films. <br /><br />Like many a romantic comedy, it centres around the make-over of the heroine; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. ████████ Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often remarkable) career; she's iconically sexy as Catwoman (poor █████ █████ never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, though, it's her scenes as Selina that impress; almost every one of them is a little comic gem, particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life. It's a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life. Nothing moves me quite like Selina and █████ █████ dancing under the mistletoe to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a gun held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos, doomed to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentality of 'Big ████' or the gossamer emotions of 'Edward Scissorhands' - this is the most heartfelt scene in all of ██████'s films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-loathing and not a little wit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - particularly Pfeiffer. <br /><br />Elsewhere, █████ de ████ almost matches her, finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent long-johns. The upper-crust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham; ██████'s Penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own, █████ Doolittle-style make-over (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). It's ██████'s most radical - and funniest - reinvention. ███████████ ██████'s Max Schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains, sliding between casual charm and blank-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and is it just me, or does his company's logo bring to mind ██████ █████? Perhaps we should ask former Disney animator ██████).<br /><br />███████████ █████'s 'Batman ██████' - a real action film - has been much praised as the first film to do justice to Batman; I admire █████'s film, but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.
