Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. ████ ██████'s terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while █████ █████████ and ██████ ███████'s authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. █████ Rock, ████ ███████ █████ ███████, ███████ ██████ and ███████ ██████ all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie ████, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.
