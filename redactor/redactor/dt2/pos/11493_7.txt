██████ (███████ ██████) married ████ (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and some days later, ████ is very depressed and leaves her, expecting to `clean the fog' in their lives. ██████ faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life, and decides to look for ████ in Texas. She is very supported by her brother ███ (█████ ███████), who meets her in the border of Mexico. There, ██████ meets the confused ████ and realizes that she can not change his decision, while ███ knows Carmen (████████ █████████) and starts dating her, and in the end `life goes on'. This movie is very unpredictable, having a very different story. I believe it is an independent production. In some parts, it is a little slow and boring, but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile. I liked it, and my vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `Rebeldes Até o ███' (`Rebels Until the End')<br /><br />
