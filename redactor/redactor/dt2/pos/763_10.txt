This movie is a great film. The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. Driving ███████ centers around ███ (██████ █████) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. The movie goes on about how ███ is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. ███ then meets ████, who he makes a very special bond with. The two take a journey and in the process ███ finds himself and what a relationship that he and ████ share. This is the movie that you watch by yourself, or with someone else. No matter what, you will all feel what ███ goes through in the movie. It is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as ███'s ███████.
