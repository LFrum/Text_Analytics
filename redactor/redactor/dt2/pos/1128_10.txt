When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time, I wasn't expecting a show with complex characters, intriguing plot lines, and impeccable writing... but that's exactly what I got.<br /><br />Greek follows several college students who are in the Greek system at ██████ ██████ University. Rusty Cartwright enters ██████ ██████ as a Polymer Science major who aspires to be in a fraternity. His older sister, █████ (the show's center and soon-to-be-president of ████ ████ ████, the most prestigious sorority on campus), isn't exactly supportive of his plans. In fact, none of her friends even knew she had a brother until he set foot on the college grounds! On top of dealing with the fact that her dorky younger brother has been forced back into her life, █████'s boyfriend ████ ████████ (soon-to-be-president of THE fraternity on campus, █████ ███) is cheating on her with a new ZBZ pledge (███████ █████), diabolical ZBZ president ███████ is pressuring her to stay with him, and she still has feelings for her slacker ex-boyfriend Cappie (president of the party house on campus, █████ ███). These characters are joined by ██████ █████ (an athletic, intelligent friend of Rusty's who happens to be gay), ████ ██████████ (Rusty's die-hard Christian and "possibly racist" roommate and best friend), and Ashleigh (█████'s quirky best friend and confidante).<br /><br />██████████ █████'s two seasons (or four chapters) viewers are often reminded that college life is not black and white, but "in shades of gray from here on out." Every character makes their fair share of mistakes, but every one of them has redeemable qualities. █████ and Cappie have a complicated, but beautiful, relationship throughout the series. Rusty, ████, and ██████'s friendship is not always perfect, but they manage to survive every obstacle that is thrown at them. Even ███████, ███████, and Evan (the show's "villains") are shown as human every once in a while.<br /><br />Greek shows college students at their best, worst, and in-between. It is a show that reveals college as what it truly is: a four-year adventure where one's morals, beliefs, and willpower are tested, compromised, and sometimes even changed.<br /><br />Greek has at least one season left, if not more, before it ends. I cannot wait to see where the characters end up next. Greek is not your typical ABC family sitcom. If you want to tune in to a show that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is the show for you.
