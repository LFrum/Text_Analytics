THE SEA INSIDE (2004) **** ██████ ██████, █████ █████, ████ ██████, █████ ██████, █████ ███████, ████ ██████, ███████ ███████, █████ █████, ████████ ███████, ████ █████ ███, ███████ ████████, ███████ █████████ ████.(Dir: █████████ ████████)<br /><br />An inspiring tale of a living death; ██████ is superb<br /><br />The true life account of Spanish quadriplegic █████ ████████ and his petition to fulfill his desire for euthanasia by the right to die may not be considered a likely source of inspiration but this film is just that.<br /><br />████████ (played superbly by ██████) was a virile, energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic diving accident (recounted horrifically in flashback with a visceral jolt to the senses) and for nearly thirty years lay paralyzed in bed while his loving family cared to his every need. Although his abilities to move were nil his mind was very much active and proved skillful as an inventor, poet, author and artist that kept his mind busy until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer in his stunted condition.<br /><br />Enter beautiful yet also afflicted with a crippling disease attorney █████ (the ethereal █████ who matches ██████ beautifully as if they were indeed soul mates) is hired to see through ████████'s final wish to end his life and in turn becomes an aide de camp when he begins to open up to her like to no one ever before. Not too long has time passed and █████ begins to investigate her charge's past discovering many letters hidden away by his family. When █████ confronts █████ with this he at first is reluctant to discuss any thing with her but eventually he agrees with her that this may help his case and the project becomes a book in the making  a memoir/biography by way of free-style poetry and prose. <br /><br />The film is a heartbreaking tale of the human spirit and how love eventually triumphs over heart ache in many forms including for █████ the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger named Rosa (Duenas) a single mother who sees him on TV one day inspiring her to bicycle to his remote farmhouse in Spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about ending his life.<br /><br />Filmmaker Amenabar, who co-wrote with █████ ███ the fascinating screenplay, allows some fantasy into the mix when █████ envisions himself magically leaving his bed and flying across the bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that has imprisoned him for three decades. The film is not a complete downer with a sly wit and occasionally humorous tone throughout that doesn't dilute the impact of the story's final act. █████ also to the remarkable make-up job by █████ and ██ █████ do a tremendous job in aging the vibrant ██████ to an aging man to full effect that should get them an ███████ █████ nod. <br /><br />██████ and █████ deserve Oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and despite █████'s █████ being married to a loving, doting husband, that a pair of people so made for one another it is down right impossible they were never together to begin with. That's just one of the cruelties that rings true but it is not by definition of the film as its whole; it is a must-see and one of the year's best.
