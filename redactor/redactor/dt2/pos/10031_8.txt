BEING ██████ Brothers' second historical drama featuring █████ ███ and Battle of the Little Big Horn, General ██████ █████████ ██████, THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON (██████ Brothers, 1941) was the far more accurate of the two; especially when contrasted with SANTA FE TRAIL (██████ Brothers, 1940), which really didn't set the bar very high.<br /><br />ALTHOUGH both pictures were starring vehicles for █████ █████, there was a change in the casting the part of General ██████. Whereas it was "Dutch", himself, ██████ ██████ portraying the flamboyant, egomaniacal Cavalryman in the earlier picture, with ███ █████ playing Virginian and later Confederate ████ General, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; █████ took on the ██████ part for THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON.<br /><br />ONCE again, the ██████ Brothers' propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the "██████'s Repertory Company" are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity, and all is really happening right before our very own eyes. Major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses, such as: █████████ Bacon/Mrs. ██████ (co-star ██████ ██ █████████), ███ ██████ (██████ ███████), ██████ █████ (Gene Lockhart), Chief █████ █████ (███████ █████), "Californy" (███████ ███████), █████ █████ (███████ ██████), General Phillip Sheridan (████ █████), Callie (the Bacon's Maid, ██████ ████████). <br /><br />THE rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited, though skilled players such as: ███ ██████, ███████ ██████, █████ ██████, ███ ███████, ██████ █████, ███ ████████, ████ ████████, ███████ ████████, █████ ████████, ███████ ████, ███████ ███████, ██████ ████████, Russell Hicks, ███████ ██████, ███████ ██████, █████ █████, ████ ██████, ███ ████████, ███████ █████, █████ ████, █████ ██████, ███████ ████████, ███ ████, ███ ██████ (All-American, himself), ███████ ██████, ████ ██████, ███ █████ and many, many more.<br /><br />THE film moves very quickly, particularly in the early goings; then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the Post █████ ███ years, the assignment of ██████ as a Colonel in the 7th Cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the Little Big Horn, in Montana. Under the guidance of Director, ████████ ███████, █████ █████, the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions; from the very serious, exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes; looking as if they were ███████ █████ █████ ███ Photos. As with most any of ███ █████'s films, he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor; but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy (farce, actually).<br /><br />AS previously mentioned, this is much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (last time we'll mention it, honest ███████, █████'s Honor!). However, that is not to say that it wasn't without a few little bits of "████████ and Literary License; as indeed, just about any Biopic will have. It would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay. Perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of Literary License is that business about ██████'s being accidentally promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. It just didn't happen that way, yet the "gag" both helped the film to move along; while it underscored the whole light, carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film.<br /><br />DIRECTOR Walsh and ███ █████ collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary █████ ███ ████ that was very close to the real life man. And they did this on top of the recreation of an incident, being the Massacre by the Lakota Sioux, the Cheyenne and the Fukowi of ██████ and his 7th Cavalry at the Little Big Horn. At the time of its occurrence, June 25, 1876, "██████'s Last Stand" was as big an incident and shock to the Americans' National Psyche as were the Japanese Attack on █████ ██████ (December 7, 1941) or the Atrocities perpetrated by the Islamic Fascists to New York's ████ █████ ██████ and the United States' Armed Forces' Headquarters in the Pentagon, █████████, Virginia on September 11, 2002.<br /><br />JUST as so many films of that period of WORLD WAR II (and the years immediately before), there were so many incidents in it that were, if not intentionally done, were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another Global Conflict, such as we were in by the time of THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON was finishing up its original Theatrical release period.<br /><br />POODLE SCHNITZ!!
