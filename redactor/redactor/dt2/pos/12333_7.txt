As part of an initiation prank █████ (Meg Tilly of Psycho 2) has to spend the night in a mausoleum, but ████ ███████████, a master of telekinesis has recently died and been put in there. When █████'s fellow sorority sisters desecrate where he's housed the real terror starts.<br /><br />This little flick had a good deal of atmosphere and I enjoyed the build up, plus the last twenty minutes are just plain great. Anyone who's looking for a lost gem of an '80's horror movie needn't look any further. Highly under-appreciated. Plus █████████ █████ is adorable.<br /><br />My Grade: B <br /><br />Media Blaster DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with director ███ ██████████ and co-writer ███████ █████; and trailers for "the Being", "Frankestien's Bloody Terror", "Just Before ████", & "█████ ███" Disc 2) Alternate director's cut (that's almost unwatchable due to a bad print) & Behind-the-scenes featurette
