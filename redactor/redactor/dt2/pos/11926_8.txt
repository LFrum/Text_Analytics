I'm seldom partial to movies about smart-assed teenagers who have problems with authority, but "███ ████████" has grown on me with repeated viewings. This is as much a movie about █████ ██████ growing up and becoming an adult as anything else, and I give credit to ████ █████ and writer/director ██████ ██████ Jr. that they don't make a big deal of that, but let it just unfold and sneak up on you. The camaraderie of Tepper's friends, their grief over ████'s death, and their joy at their survival, all are genuinely moving. And, I have to admit, I take a certain patriotic (and perhaps slightly reptilian) glee when the U.S. Army guys finally move in and righteously kick some narco-terrorist butt. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And the heroic ██████ ████ score is the cherry on top. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons not to like "███ ████████," but as long as we don't take it TOO seriously, I don't see the need. This is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.
