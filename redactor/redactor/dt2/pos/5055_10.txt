"Labyrinth of Passion"--with the possible exception of "Matador "--is █████████'s best film. It displays his unique personality at its best and least-censored, before he started going more mainstream. █████████ is just about the only modern director that can approach ███████ ███████' wonderful brand of lunacy. It's pointless to try and explain what the movie is about, the real point being █████████'s willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity, and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well.
