This is a wonderful old fashioned █████████ favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It revolves around a ██████ ███████ like journalist named █████████ ████, charmingly portrayed by ███████ ████████. However, in contrast to ██████, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include ██████ ██████ (█████████ █████), ████████ ████████ (████ █████), and ██████ ███████████ (█████████ ███████).<br /><br />█████████ ████ is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children. In reality, she is a single woman living in a New York City apartment and cannot boil an egg. Her recipes are borrowed from her Hungarian chef friend, █████. █████████ gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine, █████████ ███████, decides he wants a nice old fashioned country █████████, and invites himself to visit her, bringing with him a returning war hero, █████████ █████, a sailor who had been shipwrecked. Yardley demands total honesty of his employees. To get out of her predicament and save her deception based career, █████████ borrows the Connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor, ████ █████, a dull, fussy chap who has long sought marriage. She also borrows a neighbour's baby (actually, several) to pass off as her own and her 'husband' Sloan's.<br /><br />Of course this scenario makes for much merriment. It's a screwball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a █████████ atmosphere. Whenever I think of this movie, I picture the snowflakes falling, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire roaring in the hearth, the turkey roasting, and █████████ cookies baking.<br /><br />Why did █████████ feel compelled to do a remake? I understand there is a 1992 version, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring ████ ██████, ████ █████████████, and ████ ██████. I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I wish to. This old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday 'must see' along with It's a Wonderful Life, White █████████, ███████ on 34th Street, and of course all the versions of A █████████ Carol.
