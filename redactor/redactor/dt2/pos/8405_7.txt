Overall, I enjoyed the movie ████████. I am a huge fan of ████ with the Wind. I have read the book and seen the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of ████████ O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that ████ with the Wind is my all-time favourite book and movie. ██████ █████ and █████ █████ are remarkable actors and two of my favourites. Unfortunately, I was unable to read the book ████████, but I was excited to see the movie. Truth be told, the movie is not any where close to the calibre of ████ with the Wind and neither are the actors. However, ████ ███████ ██████ and ███████ ██████ were pleasant actors in the roles and at many times ████ sounded like ██████ █████ in her portrayal of ████████. ██████ also portrayed █████ well at times. It took some time getting used to the different actors, but overall I really enjoyed it ,being the fan of ████ with the Wind as I am. One major disappointment was that ████ did not have green eyes and ████████ O'Hara and ██████ █████ both did. I also found the Lord Fenton absolutely appalling and I did not like his character. If you are a ████ with the Wind fan and/or enjoy romantic stories, see the movie ████████. However, do not expect it to be remarkable like ████ with the Wind. It is far from it although it is interesting with the new characters and so on. I am happy it is not a remake and some of the events in the story was what I imagined the continuation to be of the ████████ O'Hara and █████ ██████ love story. If you haven't seen it today, get it tomorrowafter all tomorrow is another day. :)
