This movie has it all. Great actors, good dialog, drama, comedy, and excellent writing and directing by ████ ██████ ████████. I have seen this film several times and enjoy it more each time. It doesn't get old, it is consistently entertaining and stimulating. Easily ████ ████████ best role, and he does a great job. ████ C. Reilly and ███ ███████ also give excellent comedic performances. There is not a weak element in this film.
