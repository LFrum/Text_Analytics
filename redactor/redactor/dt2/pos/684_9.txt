"Shivering ███████████" could be considered the first classic of the "Our Gang" talkie era. By now, ███ █████ ███████ began to hit their stride in making talking pictures, and "███████████" is the happy result.<br /><br />The Gang is appearing in a version of Quo Vadis produced by ███████ the Cop's wife. The kids don't find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines. Among the funniest bits are ███████ the Cop as the giant, who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancing girl (played by director ███ ███████'s daughter.)<br /><br />Several filmographies mention that "███████████" has the first pie fight in a talkie. This may be true, seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight. ██████ ██████'s brother █████ is at the receiving end of one of the pies. Very funny and an early Gang talkie classic. 9 out of 10.
