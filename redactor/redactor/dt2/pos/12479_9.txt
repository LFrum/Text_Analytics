Great artists, always suffered while they were young. I could mention ██████ and █████████, but that is not the point. <br /><br />This movie was made by H-G ███████ whose family wanted him to succeed in the Law professions.<br /><br />Its main star is █████ ██████ who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming "The Greatest Actor" and also director of France's Theater before and after WWII.<br /><br />They both had health problems. ███████ had TB while young, ██████ had cardiac problems and died on a theater..<br /><br />Such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). One might even say that today's Artists are so poor, because they had never suffered and fought for their lives.<br /><br />To me, this is the greatest of ███████'s movies. "Wages of Fear" is greater in "suspense", "Diabolique" also has more "suspense" and a better plot and is more about "female evil".<br /><br />Quai des ████████ is more human. ███████ was falsely accused by ██ ██████'s entourage (mostly communists and Jews) of collaboration with the Nazis and banned from making films until until ██ ██████ left France's Government in early 1946. ██ ██████ came back in 1958, as President.<br /><br />The main characters are all good souls: █████ L'Amour may perform as a "putain" on stage, but she is not a "whore" (dictionaires make synonyms of those words, but they are not the same), loves her husband, and refuses the slight "advances from her (presumably Lesbian) friend ████, the photographer.<br /><br />Maurice the husband is jealous and timid, but runs away from the scene of the crime. He is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love..<br /><br />Antoine, the detective (interpreted by the great █████ ██████, basically a stage actor, performs in this French "Gray" not ████, as well as E.G. ████████ in "██████ █████████") shows flair for pseudo criminals, tenderness for a Negro son(?), and compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some nobleman's château!!<br /><br />███████ was capable of slapping an actor's face in order to put him in the right frame of mind, but deep inside he was very human. <br /><br />I have his horoscope in front of me. He had █████ in Sagittarius which means open-heartedness, devotion, charity and altruism. For those who do not believe in Astrology, my most sincere apologies...
