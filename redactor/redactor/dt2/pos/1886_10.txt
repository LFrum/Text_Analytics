This is screamingly funny (well, except when █████ is in the hospital scene, which is a little sad). <br /><br />Ted Raimi and █████ █████ are both excellent and worth watching.<br /><br />Sure, it's not a big budget-suit controlled blockbuster, but it's everything it promises to be and more- and BTW- the women are wonderful in their parts, though I don't know them from other movies, I'd welcome seeing them again.<br /><br />The two-brain walking scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for █████'s outstanding physical comedy- he is one yummy guy!<br /><br />Thanks █████, for your brain, this is your baby!
