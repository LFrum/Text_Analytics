█████████'s remake of his 1934 film concerns about the known story of McKenna marriage(█████ ███████, █████ Day, in the first version ██████ █████, ████ ████) along with their 11-years-old son travelling through ███████ during vacations. In a bus they know a sympathetic French person(██████ █████, in the old version ██████ ███████). While they are in Marrakech they also know a couple(███████ █████ and ██████ ██ ██████) and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing, the dying whispers a political message.Then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help to ███████'s Inspector Buchanan(█████ ██████).<br /><br />This is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they're forced into action is excellently played by █████ ███████ and █████ Day. This exciting film displays suspense, intrigue, tension, and interesting drama well written by ████ ███████ █████ and ███████ ███████ . Packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician: innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny, intelligent villains. Colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in ███████ and London studios by cameraman ██████ █████, though with excessive transparency for Marrakech scenes. Lavish sets by █████ ████████, █████████'s usual, and working until his recent death. Of course,the highlights are the happenings of the famous Royal ██████ ████ of London assassination where a sneering killer, ██████ ██████, tries to execute while composer ███████ ████████ is conducting orchestra. Besides at the climax █████ Day singing ¨Que sera, Que sera¨, meantime her son suffering risks, the song won █████ for ███ █████, ███ ███████████ . The story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining. Rating : better than average, █████████'s enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it.
