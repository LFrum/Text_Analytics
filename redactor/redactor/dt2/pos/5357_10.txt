When ███████ and ██████ burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short, "A Grand Day Out," they created a fresh new look at claymation. After two more shorts, ███████'s dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. It has an excellent Voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only ███████ could do! <br /><br />In this movie, ███████ and ██████ run "Anti-Pesto," a rabbit removal company. When word gets out about a "Were-Rabbit" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. Of course, ██████ ████████████, the town's handsome, toupee-brandishing huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely ████ ██████████...but can our favorite ███████ duo save the day before chaos ensues?<br /><br />The jokes, I should say, were hilarious. One point, the villain, ██████ ████████████'s, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: "BEWARE...THE MOON!!!" ███████ ███████!<br /><br />The characters are crisp and hilarious. Our favorite ███████ team of Man and Dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second Oscar (remember "A Grand Day Out?"). ██████ ██████ ██████ was terrific as the lovely ████ ██████████, ███████'s love interest. █████ ███████ was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter ██████ ████████████. But the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief. <br /><br />Hats off to ███████ for creating another ███████ and ██████ masterpiece!
