A fantastic film featuring great Aussie talent. Director ████ ████████ dealt with the potentially sob-inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing. Definitely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. Australian film veteran, ███ █████ was, as always, fabulous in the role of Frank's uni professor and new talent ████ ██████ gave a performance which will have people saying, " you know, ████ ██████, ████'s dad!" Get out and see this movie!!!
