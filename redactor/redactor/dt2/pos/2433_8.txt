Making this short and to the point. This movie was great! I loved it! I actually picked this up at a Hollywood Video for 3 bucks on VHS and watched it about 5 times in the last couple weeks. I'm a big ██████ fan and I just latched onto this movie. I thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone. ██████ ██████ is great and pulls off a good ██████. His nose is a little big, his voice is a ██████-Columbo mix, and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise, he was fantastic and this film was wonderful. No one can be a perfect ██████ but he was great. Remember, ███ ██████ is a fan of ██████ and isn't going to do everything he did. He mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real ██████'s character's. But, it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast, including some beautiful women. Watch it and have fun!
