Long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and "Cover Girl" is no exception to the rule.<br /><br />A story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous. The old adage applies here- that happiness and fame always don't mix.<br /><br />The dance routines are marvelously choreographed. What dancing and chemistry between ████ ████████ and Gene █████.<br /><br />Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers ████████, when he sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the aisle-████████'s grandmother Maribel.<br /><br />A jealous reaction by █████ drives Rusty (████████) into the arms of Broadway producer ███ Bowman.<br /><br />The picture is basically history repeating itself at the end.<br /><br />To add to the glory of this fine film, there is the always wise-cracking Eve Arden and the hilarious ████ ███████, appropriately named ██████ in the film.
