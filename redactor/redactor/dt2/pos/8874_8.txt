You don't see the meaning of the title till much later, but you get the point of it in the first few minutes. This directorial debut from Golden Globe nominated (for actor) █████ ██████, also playing ████/Ned 'Little Ned' ████, is a terrific Hitchcock-like film about one man's hate for his wife's book (she stole his), and one man's hate for his mother. Basically, ████ wants to be a good writer, like his teacher █████ ██████ (█████ ███████), and he inspired by murder stories. █████ suggests he see a Hitchcock film, quite ironic, and that is when ████ has the idea to kill █████'s ex-wife, ████████ (Star Trek Voyager's Kate Mulgrew). ████ is inspired by 'Strangers on a Train', swapping murders, so █████ must kill ████'s horrible █████ (█████ and Golden Globe nominated ████ ██████). █████ was convinced ████ killed ████████, and also that he had to/wanted to kill ████'s █████, but there is a happy ending when months later both █████ and ████ bring out books, █████ died naturally, and they went on a holiday with ████ ████ (███ ██████). Also starring ███ ██████ as ████ and █████ ███████. With hilarious moments, a great director/actor and his support, this is a must-see comedy. Very, very good!
