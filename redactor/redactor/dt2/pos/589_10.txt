I've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie, But Just The Half. Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kelly's ██████'s House. The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So █████████. They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow, ██████ Can Make It, No Matter How Small, No Matter How Green(█████ ███ ████████ In The Trailer).<br /><br />██████ ██ ██ ████████ ███████████(█████ Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets. ███ ██████ ███ Amazing When He Played █████████ ███ ████████. The Scene Where Miss Piggy Saves Kermit By Doing ████ ██ On Those Guys.
