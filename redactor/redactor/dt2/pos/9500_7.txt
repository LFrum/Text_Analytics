Don't Change Your Husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from █████ ██ ███████. On the other it is his first picture to star ██████ ███████, probably the greatest actress of the silent era, and is the film which made her a star.<br /><br />Although the old DeMille formula was beginning to change, and his films were becoming wordier and less purely visual, with such an expressive performer as ███████ we regain much of that silent storytelling style. Her character does very little, but conveys volumes through subtle gesture and facial expression  with a particular talent for looks of disdain. In real life ███████ was herself coming towards the end of her disastrous marriage to ███████ █████, and it's possible that this fact fuelled her convincing performance.<br /><br />As if to best complement his leading lady's talents, DeMille's use of framing and close-ups is particularly strong here. He uses cinematic technique to show off the acting  often holding ███████ in lengthy close-ups at key moments  and also to clarify the story visually. For example, when we are introduced to the character of Toodles, she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror. Her character disappears from the story, only to become important towards the end. That attention-grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was. Later, at the anniversary dinner, ███████ and future husband number two ███ ████ are framed together in one shot, while ██████ ██████ is isolated in his own frame. Also  and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general  there is much use of reaction shots  for example the disapproving glance of the bishop when ████ acts out his intentions with the wedding figure dolls.<br /><br />In contrast to DeMille's visual narrative method was the increasingly verbose screen writing of his collaborator ██████ ██████████. As I've remarked in several other comments, ██████████ could put together a strong and dramatic story, but like DeMille she tended to state her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style. And so we get these very long quasi-philosophical title cards about the pitfalls of married life which, if they improve the story at all, it is only because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only ██████ ██████████ could come up with a line like "Fate sometimes lurks in Christmas shopping". Fortunately though in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than break them up.<br /><br />Although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small scale, it is at this point that DeMille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular. You can see him start to sneak in excuses for a bit of razzmatazz like the little fantasy scenes of ███████ being showered with "Pleasure, wealth and love". It wouldn't be until the early twenties after the unofficial embargo on historical pictures was lifted that he would get the chance to go all out with the grand spectacle.<br /><br />All in all, Don't Change Your Husband is a fairly decent DeMille silent picture, although to be honest it is only really the presence ██████ ███████ that lifts it above the average. It's curious though that this is supposedly a comedy, and ███████ was cast at least in part because of her background at Mack Sennett's slapstick factory. She hated comedy acting, and here gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance. It makes sense then that the only straight drama she did with DeMille, Male and Female, was by far the strongest of their collaborations.
