█████ ██████ created a somewhat conventional biopic about the ███████ ████████ flight. He structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell the ████████ story leading up to the famous flight across the Atlantic, which happens in present time in the film. Flying an airplane for hour after hour is not the stuff of excitement, and ██████ is not going to deviate from his theme of ████████ as hero of the common man, so things are predictable. However, █████ ███████ is well cast and quite believable as ████████, and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to get his plane in the air keep one watching. <br /><br />The film comes through most successfully as ██████ weaves the parts of the story together in a way that create tension, then relief, then tension again. The cinematography is quite good, score by █████ ██████ enhances the scenes, and ███████ really seems to make ████████ come alive, makes one believe he could be ████████. There is a bit of 1950's religious schmaltz at the end, but overall the direction, acting, and high production values overcome the predictability of the story (would anybody REALLY see this picture and NOT know that ████████ made it across the Atlantic?) to make an enjoyable film that has aged better than most films from that time. █████ ██████ made films of a wide variety of types, and this is one that is representative of his craftsman-like best.
