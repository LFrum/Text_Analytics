This is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. It's certainly all been done before and since. But The Violent Men is something special.<br /><br />What makes it special is ███████ ████████ playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. She's married to the crippled ██████ ██ ████████ who's the cattle baron here, but ████████ is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. No matter to Barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law █████ █████. That doesn't sit well with either ██████ ██████ who is ████████ and ████████'s daughter, nor with ████ █████ who is █████'s Mexican girl friend.<br /><br />The infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but █████ ████ as the stalwart small rancher who is a Civil War veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. He's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost expect those famous words from ████ ████ ███████ to come out of Ford's mouth, "I'm a peaceable man." Would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Men.<br /><br />The Fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before. The following year █████ ████ would do another western, █████, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component.<br /><br />There's enough traditional western stuff in The Violent Men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.
