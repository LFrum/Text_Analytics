A group of young travelers that just ran out of gas go into a weird wax museum called "████████'s Lost █████" owned by a strange man named Slausen (█████ ███████) as the dummies are controlled by some mysterious force and a madman with special powers wants them dead.<br /><br />One of the most under-appreciated horror movies of the late 70's! This ███████ ████ (producer of "Re-Animator")production has became one of the scariest and most unique low budget horror productions of it's day combining some psychological themes along without having to result some gore like the usual slasher movie. The movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats with tension and some scares, the movie has became a cult diamond in the rough for the genre since then and this is well worth watching.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Pin", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974)", "The Hills have Eyes ( 1977)", "Maniac ( 1980)", "Magic" ( 1978), "Dolls", "May", "Just Before ████", "House of 1000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects", "█████████ ████", "██████'s Day", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Friday The 13th", "Halloween 1 & 2", "██████ ██████", "House of Wax ( 1953 and 2005)", "Jeepers Creepers", "High Tension", "████ ████ II", "From ████ ████ ████", "Waxwork", "Nothing But ███████" and "Psycho ( 1960)".
