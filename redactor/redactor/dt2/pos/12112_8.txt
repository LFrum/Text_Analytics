"███████ ████, ████ of the Far West" director █████ █████'s unsavory Spaghetti western "The Beast" with █████ ██████ could only have been produced in Europe. Hollywood would never dared to have made a western about a sexual predator on the prowl as the protagonist of a movie. Never mind that ██████ is ideally suited to the role of 'Crazy' ██████. He plays an individual entirely without sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit, pants, and hat. This low-budget oater has nothing appetizing about it. The typically breathtaking Spanish scenery around Almeria is nowhere in evidence. Instead, █████ and his director of photography ███████ ████████, who shot another ██████ western "And ███ Said to Cain," lensed this horse opera in rather mundane setting around ███ ███████, █████, Italy and █████ ██████ █████, █████ █████, █████, Italy. Nevertheless, "The Beast" qualifies as a Continental western because it deals with wholly unscrupulous characters and the action could be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that compel them to resort to criminal activities. Predictably, their well-laid plans backfire owing largely to the ██████ character. Indeed, the licentious ██████ character resembles a Wily E. Coyote type character. Consistently, he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women but either lawmen or outlaws frustrate each of his efforts. Ultimately, "The Beast" amounts to a tragic character study brimming with irony. The Stelvio Cipriani orchestral score sounds as if it were lifted by the Tony Anthony western "The Stranger Returns." The █████ █████ screenplay takes place on the western frontier between ███ █████ and Mexico that is being terrorized by a notorious Mexican bandit called ███████ (Giovanni Pallavicino of "We Still Kill the Old Way") and his gang. They prey on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their depredations. The first time that we see 'Crazy' ██████ Laster he pauses to refresh himself at a stream and spots a gorgeous looking woman washing clothes. He creeps up behind her and attacks her, but a bigger man armed with a rifle intervenes and he has to flee. He shows up in a nearby town and a snuff-snorting gunslinger recruits him to help ambush a wealthy man, ███ █████s, on the trail and rob him. They wind up killing him and getting no money. ██ █ Snuff-sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene of the crime and the sheriff arrests on suspicion of murder. 'Crazy' shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so that he doesn't have to worry about being implicated in the crime.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a young couple in love are having trouble making their way in the world. ████████ (██████ ████ of "Requiem for a Bounty Killer") lives a Mexican couple on their ranch and helps them raise their real son ████. In the village, ████████'s lovely girlfriend ███████ (█████████ █████████ of "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in the cantina. ████████ and ███████ plan to marry, but the last place that ███████ wants to settle down is on a dusty ranch. She dreams of living in the city, but life in the city requires more money than either ████████ or she has. They team up with a blond outlaw name ████ (█████ ███████ of "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead") and they plan to kidnap ███ █████'s daughter █████ when she comes to get her inheritance. ████ makes the fatal mistake of enlisting 'Crazy' ██████ to help them because ████ knows that ██████ needs the money to get women.<br /><br />They abduct Powers' daughter and keep her at a remote cabin with ██████ standing guard over her. Meantime, ███████ masquerades as Powers' daughter and shows up in town to get the money from Powers' attorney ████ █████████ (████████ █████████ of "█████ and █████ ████"), but he grows suspicious because ███████ doesn't look anything like he remembered █████. ████████ brandishes his six-gun and warns █████████ that they have kidnapped █████. Unfortunately for ████████ and ███████, █████████ can only lay his hands on $50-thousand because ███████ has struck such fear into the hearts of everybody that the Powers' total inheritance cannot be shipped through the territory by stagecoach. Meanwhile, back at the cabin, horny ██████ tries to rape █████, but she outsmarts him, knows him out with a chair on the pretense of needing to be alone while she undresses. After she knocks him unconscious, she steals a buggy and drives it back to town. ██████ recovers, pursues her and murders her about the same time that ████, ████████, ███████, and █████████ meet him on the trail. They inform ██████ about the complications created by ███████'s reign of terror and give him $12-thousand as his cut of the money. █████████ is aghast at the sight of █████'s bloodstained corpse and threatens ██████. Naturally, ██████ guns him down in cold blood on the spot.<br /><br />Things really begin to deteriorate as the law in ███ █████ sets out to capture ███████. ████, ████████, and ███████ return to Mexico while ██████ attacks two women at a ranch and narrowly escapes getting caught. He rides to Mexico, finds a cantina whore and is going down on her when a bounty shoves a revolver in his face. ██████ confesses that he knows where they can find more money if they will release him. ███████'s men follow up on ██████'s tip and capture ███████. The villagers join ████████ to attack ███████ and ██████ rescues ███████ but she dies later on after a big shoot-out. ████████ is left standing alone now. ███████ and his men retaliated against his step parents, not only killing them but also little ████. Everything that ████████ and ███████ dreamed up having goes up in clouds of gun smoke for an unhappy ending. 'Crazy' ██████ dies and never gets to assuage his lust. If you think about █████'s uncompromising sagebrusher, "The Beast" emerges as an interesting character study and an exercise in film noir in a western setting where everybody is punished.
