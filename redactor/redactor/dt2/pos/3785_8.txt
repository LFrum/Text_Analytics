This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent ███████ features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that ███████ re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (███████ in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age. ███████'s dealing with World War I, a hideous conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst war (horrible to say) of the 20th Century. ███████ would live to see that war too, and would spoof it's main architects in THE GREAT DICTATOR. But the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that movie is a talking picture. Also, ██████ as a target seems more important to audiences in 2008 than ██████ ███████ ██ and his general staff.<br /><br />SHOULDER ARMS was to take us through the drafting of the tramp, his training, his getting use to trench warfare, and his actual fighting against the "Huns" on the Western Front. Much of this is now gone - one segment (when ██████ ██████ is a Doctor examining ███████ in his office at the draft center) is still in existence and was shown completely in the documentary UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. This is unfortunate, because the film is now roughly forty five minutes long, and there seems to be gaps that these scenes filled out. What remains is first rate but one leaves wanting more...and feeling a trifle cheated.<br /><br />Sydney ███████ and █████ ███████ do well in supporting parts, especially Sydney as ███████. He had done it before in a short with ███████ for the sale of bonds, giving a militaristic speech before being clobbered by the tramp with a huge hammer labeled "War Bonds"). Here we see the tramp succeed in capturing ███████ and the general staff at the conclusion. It was only topped by ████ and █████ capturing the German army with a tank and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES.<br /><br />The funny thing is that ███████ actually had a major crisis as a result of his wartime activities. He was not a naturalized American - not in 1917 or in 1952, when ████████ ███████ McGranery publicly announced that ███████ could not return to the U.S. because he was an enemy alien (███████ and his family were in Europe on a trip - in anger ███████ settled in Switzerland for the rest of his life, except when he made A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG and when he went to Hollywood for his special career "Oscar" in the 1970s). Because he was not an American he could not be drafted by the U.S. So he sold (with ███████ █████████ Sr. and ████ ████████) U. S. War Bonds. But in Great Britain tens of thousands had perished in World War One battlefields, and the public there was upset at ███████, who they considered a "slacker" and a coward. ███████ eventually did overcome this, but remnants of the resentment followed him until he died. This does not detract from the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a film, but it does suggest why ███████ did not do another modern war film until 1940, and a worthier target.
