This story of the troubles caused by an over-possessive, overpowering, domineering and unscrupulous mother (█████ ████ █████) for her two grown sons, and their girls, is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by █████ ████ (the new daughter-in-law), ████ ██████ (the number-one son), ████ ██████ (the number-two son) and ███████ ███ (fiance of number-two son). Here's the show of the pure tyranny of mother's jealousy and possessiveness run amok as four good people find their owns lives damaged, their plans changed and their own identities in jeopardy. █████ ████ is stellar in her role. ████ ██████'s performance is open and clear and █████ ████ █████ is masterful as the mother.<br /><br />Yet this reviewer finds ███████ ███'s performance the best of all. Hers is the first character in the story to show the strength of her inner feelings. Her portrayal in her heartbreak broken-engagement scene is gut-wrenching, and even raw. Dee yanks the viewer around and drives you into her pain without even showing her face ! <br /><br />███████ ███, like █████ ████ █████, has been too long overlooked, and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was. No actress who started in film after WWII has had anything to speak of on ███████ ███.<br /><br />If you're lucky enough to see The Silver Cord, which was never released for TV, you'll find this "old fashioned drawing-room drama" to be an outstanding film that shows very well 74 years after its 1933 release because it is filled with superb performances.
