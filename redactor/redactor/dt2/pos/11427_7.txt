Mud and Sand is one of ████ ██████'s spoofs of the popular movies at the time, this one being of ███████ █████████'s █████ and Sand (hence Stan being ███████ ████████). While partly inconsistent on characterization (how did he defeat those bulls in the beginning is not explained), this was mostly funny from beginning to end with one of the best sequences being a dance he does with his then common-law wife, ███ ██████. Another funny sequence concerns his reluctance with romancing a femme fatale, █████ ██ ████, while his wife, ███████, is waiting for him that shows some glimpses of his later innocent character with ██████ █████. Well worth seeing for anyone interested in seeing ███ ██████'s early work before his fateful teaming that made him popular around the world.
