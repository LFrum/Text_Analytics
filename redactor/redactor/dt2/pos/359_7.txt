Being the second last of ███████'s ███████ films, CARMEN is a parody of █████ ██ ███████'s drama with the same title. It stands as quite obvious that ███████'s acknowledged film didn't impress the comedy king that much, which he later admitted in his autobiography.<br /><br />Parodies were not a new experiment for ███████. He had done several of them already, namely HIS PREHISTORIC PAST and HIS NEW JOB, and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films (for instance in A KING IN NEW YORK).<br /><br />███████ does a very good portrayal of ███ ████, and ████ █████████'s is very as good as ██████. Neither act as we are used to; ███████ is not the lovable Tramp and ████ is far from an innocent little woman, but that was not ███████'s intentions, either. A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat odd ███████-film, very different, but includes good material nonetheless.<br /><br />The main story is, although very differently structured, as in the original drama. ███ ████ is very much in love with ██████, but is not alone in that field; "██████, ██████, (the) beautiful ██████, (is) loved by all men under 96," but he has the big advantage that he is an officer, and there we are; this is the famous story about rivalry, love, greed and honor, seen from a humorous perspective. Thanks to ███████'s and Purviance's performances, and to the wonderful, wonderful music by ██████ █████ which I highly admire, this could actually have been a near-comedy masterpiece, it's time taken into consideration. It could have been. But unfortunately, although it is a good pretty good comedy, I don't feel it's fair to blame people who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece. But it's important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent, but rather a result of conflicts concerning business. When ███████ refused to re-sign ███████ contract after completing his last film for the company, POLICE, they took revenge by editing back all the scenes ███████ originally had edited out from CARMEN. Thanks to this, the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny, and the film turned out to be rather a Ben ██████-feature --██████ played ██████████-- than a ███████-short. Naturally, ███████ was in despair when he discovered what ███████ had done, and had to stay in bed for several days.<br /><br />Despite its obvious flaws, A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended to ███████-fans and to admirers of beautiful music.
