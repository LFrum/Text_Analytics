The funniest movie from Britain I have ever seen, "The Supergrass" is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas, and murder by the seaside. ██████ Carter (██████ ████████), average moron, is out to impress his so-called girlfriend, ██████ (Dawn French), because she thinks he is too law-abiding. So, to get her to come along with him on a romantic getaway, he comes up with a scheme that perhaps will impress her and entice her to spend some time with him. Trouble is, ██████' lie is that he's somehow gotten involved in an international drugs ring, and while telling her, a couple of policemen overhear his boasting and nick him. And so begins this witty movie, full of slick comedy and crude jokes. ██████ is banged up in the local nick, and, much to the arresting officers' delight, there seems to be no way out (██████'s earlier attempts to explain it was all a lie were dismissed by a hilarious melody of "Stand by Your Man" by the two officers'). Then comes along Commander Robertson (██████ █████), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He makes a deal with ██████, that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers, then he will be set free and allowed whatever he pleases. ██████ agrees, and is teamed up with ██████ ██████ (█████ ██████████), and ██████ ████████ (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable rib-tickling experience, with ██████ ████████ as Sergeant Troy adding humourous colour to the film. His walk along the dry-dock against "███████ ████ To █████████'s Two Tribes" is superb, and probably the best scene in motion picture history. The two officers' who nick ██████ are wonderfully played by ███████ ███████ and ███████ ██████, and ██████ █████ as the motorcycle cop is a laugh! If you want something good to watch on a Saturday night, then I suggest you rent this. You won't forget it!
