This has one of the more unusual plots I've seen in a horror film, but it's based on good, solid Universal Studios fare: Lots of monsters, pretty heroine, torch-bearing villagers. But my favorite part is █████ ██████ (The ████ ███) searching for the cure for his lycanthropy. After dying in the original "████ ███," he is resurrected and wanders through "████████████ Meets the ████ ███" and "House of ████████████" searching for a way to end his affliction. I think first-time viewers will find his search in this particular movie very interesting.<br /><br />
