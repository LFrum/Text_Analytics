25 sitcoms had big screen spin-offs. Most of these came in the 1970's. Here is a list of all: Are you █████ Served, ██████████, Bless this House, ██████, ████ ████, ██████ ████ ██████, For the ████ of Ada, ██████ and ███████, The League of Gentlemen, ████ thy █████████, The ████rs, ███ about the House, ███████ and Dearest, █████ ████ the Quality Feel the Width, On the Buses (3), ██████ ███, Porridge, Rising ████, ███████ and Son (2), That's your Funeral, ████ █████ us do Part (2), Up Pomeii (3), Whack-o, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads and ██████ Apocalypse.<br /><br />So there was a big-screen spin off of my all time favourite sitcom ████ ████. What the film focused on was when the men were enrolled. It showed the difficulties of getting a uniform and getting weapons. It was a big summary of the first series of ████ ████. At the end of the film they catch some German Spies in the church. The Home Guard come dressed as alter servers and had bayonets with them and defeated the Germans. The best bit in the film was when they were showing a HG lecture and a German lecture at the same time: German: Head office on the phone, would you get 10,000 bombs, (CUT TO HOME GUARD) GODFREY: Mrs Mainwaring on the phone, would you get 1/2lb of ███████ Sprouts.<br /><br />This was probably the second best sitcom spin off movie, beaten only by ████ █████ us do Part (1969). It would have been better if at the start of the movie, it had already been formed, it was half way through the war. Though still an excellent movie, a good one for the family.
