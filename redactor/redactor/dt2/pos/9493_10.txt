I just re-watched a few episodes of this series on very poor VHS tapes that I recorded the series on. I'm glad I did, though.<br /><br />██████ is based on the children's books by ███████ ██████ and follows the adventures of the title eight-year-old (█████ ██████). She has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are pretty good. "Mystery Meal" kind of grosses me out as a vegan, but it's funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue! And any episode that mentions ████████ ██████ The Smog Monster twice can't be all bad. I like "██████'s Bad Day" even more. Although it's disheartening to see ██████ going through a rough day, she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend █████'s uncle (a pre-Psi Factor ███████ ████), who always teases her. "The Perfect Day" is also good.<br /><br />Lori Chodos plays ██████, ██████'s sister. I swear I've seen her on something else, but IMDb doesn't list anything besides this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every crappy show made these days on DVD except something I'd actually like to buy? An injustice if there ever was one!
