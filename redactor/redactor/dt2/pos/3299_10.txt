"Boy Next Door" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to ██████ █████ for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since █████ █████. And what a treat to see ███████ ████ back again. If you thought all he could do was play "Bull" the bailiff on "█████ █████", think again. This gem of a film showcases the brilliantly funny writing of ███████ ██████. Remember that name. Forget ███████ ███████, █████ ██████ is the true current king of quirky comedy.
