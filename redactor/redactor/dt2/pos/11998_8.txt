This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite ███████ episodes ever. The acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is ingenious, and the direction is fabulous.<br /><br />█████ ████, who acts brilliantly in every ███████ episodes, acts particularly well in this episode.<br /><br />Also, great performances from ███████ ███████, ████ ███████████, ████ █████ and ██████ Culp.<br /><br />The ending is absolutely brilliant and I love the way ███████ describes it.<br /><br />This is a ███████ movie that WON'T, go amiss.
