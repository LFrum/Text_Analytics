Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. <br /><br />The movie starts with █████████ ████ (███████ ████████). "███" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha ███████' of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over █████████. In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for █████████, invites himself up to the farm for the █████████ party. From there, things just go crazy.<br /><br />Since the movie is set on a New England farm, the movie has a warm holiday feeling. Plus, the characters are hilarious. ██ █ Yardley is always shouting orders, and ███'s friend █████ is always yelling 'Catastroph!' when things go wrong. Finally, the movie ends the way a █████████ movie should end; a jolly fat man laughs and shouts "What a █████████!" <br /><br />In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.
