████████ at her villainous best, ████████ her equal - as ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western.<br /><br />Some good action scenes, strong use of location, colour and Cinemascope. But why the obvious use of stock footage in the stampede scene?<br /><br />Ford is dependable as always and ██████ is strong as ████████'s daughter, but it is the baddies' film. And it's not just ████████ and ████████ - Brian Keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as ████████'s lover, and ███████ ███████ is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer.<br /><br />See it for the camp value.
