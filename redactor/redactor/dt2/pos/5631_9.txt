I rented this movie for two reasons. The first was all of the good things that I read about it. I definately was impressed, and couldn't agree more with all of the reviews I read. The second reason is because I know these guys. I don't know ████ as well as I do ████. He hasn't changed much from the years we knew each other. I know him as "the reaper" from a local █████████ radio station (WMSE). The way he is in this film is genuinely ████ 100%. He once gave me a table that he made. It was a little one, about 15" high, that said █████████ on it. The odd thing about it was it only had two legs. Sometimes it's the thought that counts, and ████ always has thought about others first.
