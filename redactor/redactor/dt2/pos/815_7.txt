"█████ ████" is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author ████ █████. Lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934. ██████ ██████ as a mouthy little punk. He seems to be in the film for comedic and homey "family values". ████ ███████ again plays the strong-willed mother, just as she had in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow Incident. ███ Sothern is █████, who has been dating ████ (████ █████), but meets up with rich ███ ████████, played by ████ ████████, who may or may not be better for her. You can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the Hays production code -- at one point, █████ says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house...what a change from just a year or two prior, when anything and everything was OK. Good solid plot, but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk. It raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice, or just find a man with big bucks, as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated...? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. TV viewers from the 1960s will recognize ████████ as Commissioner Gordon from Batman..... Also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one --████ █████ had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle. ██████ ██████ had an affair with █████ ███████, who was 20 years older; ██████ ended up being married eight times. █████ Brooke (Emory) and ███████ ████████ (Pa) both knocked themselves off in real life. The title "█████ ████" has been reused many times, for films, TV series, and even cartoons, but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.
