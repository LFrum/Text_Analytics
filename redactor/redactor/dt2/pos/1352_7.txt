████ ███████ both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel. ███████ was a well known good writer & director, mostly westerns.<br /><br />██████ ███████ was a star for over 20 years when he made this. This role was like many he had made already,One can see why he was a big star for so many years.<br /><br />He filled this role easily like a well used glove.<br /><br />The title character is played by ██████ ██████ Jr. (his father a fine actor ██████ ██████--died tragically at age 32---his mother is noted actress ████████ █████).<br /><br />██████ was of slight build & even though he had talent only made a few films. (he was in Rita Hayworth's near last film.<br /><br />ROAD TO SALINAS ---the same year & was very good).<br /><br />He looked very much like his father, but seemed to lack his fathers charm. He made only a few more movies. He is still living & I wish him well.<br /><br />Most of his scenes are with another son of a Hollywood great. ████ █████████'s son █████, who is still making movies. they made a nice team.<br /><br />In westerns you always have a female character & usually she is a dance hall performer. (today they call them hookers), █████ █████████ assays this role nicely. also featured are western stalwarts, ████ ████████ & ████ Kelly.<br /><br />It was film in Old Tucson )outside of downtown ██████ ██,. & the scenery is gorgeous.<br /><br />Typical of the older westerns, there is not too much action,there is some good humour & the usual ending shoot out.<br /><br />It is a fast enjoyable 89 minutes.<br /><br />Ratings: *** (out of 10) 84 points(out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
