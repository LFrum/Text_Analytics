Although a made for cable film by HBO, it is an enjoyable movie and a fascinating look at the back-stabbing and double-dealing world of television. Allowing the viewer to peek behind the scenes of the so-called late night talk show wars in the early 90s, as ███ ████ and █████ █████████ competed for the coveted position as host of the Tonight Show. █████ Bates gives a bravo performance as ████'s mercurial manager █████ ████████ and one can feel empathy for what ████/█████████ endured at the hands of tv executives. It is just as timely now, considering the recent events involving the failed attempt by ABC to replace █████████ with █████████. No matter how many times I have seen this film, I still find it as much a pleasure to watch as I did when it first aired. If this should ever be released on DVD, I would certainly add it to my collection.
