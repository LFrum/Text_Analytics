This film is where the ██████ franchise ought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind "██████ ███████" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.<br /><br />Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second ██████ film from ███ ██████ turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from ██████, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how "██████ ███████" can be considered at all disappointing.<br /><br />True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in "██████," a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of ██████ and ████ █████████ as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the ██████ was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.<br /><br />███████ ██████ returns as the ██████ and his alter ego █████ █████, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon ███ ███████ (███████████ ██████, named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor), his partner-in-crime ██████ █████████, the Penguin (█████ ██████ in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's "███████ ███"), and ██████ ████, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom █████ romances both as himself and as the ██████. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially ██████ and DeVito, while together ██████ and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.<br /><br />There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under ██████ and ██████.
