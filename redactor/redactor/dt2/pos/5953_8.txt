████ ████████ gets ███████'s mannerisms down pat: the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him, the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie, the swaggering, steely gait. It's uncanny, and you come to realise just how much of Bond in the Sixties was ███████'s creation and not really ███ ███████'s character. <br /><br />The cinematography is a nod to those early films, the movie takes off From Russia With ████ and Thunderball mainly. The main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is, not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism, and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to Egypt. <br /><br />It's not perfect - about 20 mins in it seems a one-joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day, of which there were plenty. Morcecambe and ████'s The Intelligence Men had suspect-looking men in fez's following their heroes around too, and that's going back a bit. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau or █████ █████'s █████, ████████ doesn't give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his ███████ mannerisms. It doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song, and there's no funny or serious villain, like ████ █████' Dr Evil or ███████ █████████'s █████ ███ nemesis, for the hero to go up against.<br /><br />But the scene where OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three-quarters empty cinema, and the whole thing looks wonderful, plus you'll never get a chance to see █████████ ███ ███████ on the screen, and the women are ace crumpet, really hot. It's a Bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist/Ken ████ sets or funny gadgets routine. Throughly recommended.
