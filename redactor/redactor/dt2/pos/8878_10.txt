This movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies I have ever seen. █████ ██ ████ plays ████ perfectly. Momma is excellently portrayed, and was one of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect. █████ is trying to write a book and is having some troubles. █████ teaches a writing class and ████ tagged after █████ trying to get him to read his story. ████ eventually asks █████ to kill his mother, and in return ████ would kill █████'s ex-wife. The whole movie was really hilarious.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when ████ writes "█████ █████ from the Train". █████ gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot. It turns out that ████ wrote a children's pop-up book.<br /><br />I would really recommend this movie. I gave it a 10.
