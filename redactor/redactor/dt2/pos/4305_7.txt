██████ Shock is one of the many good ███████ episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.<br /><br />It has all the elements we like in the ███████ episodes. We get the laugh when ███████ makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in ██████ Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.<br /><br />We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles ███████. The end is the usual, we get the story about how ███████ solved the mystery.<br /><br />This is another good ███████-episode, and I will rate it 7/10. It is close to 8/10.<br /><br />"Just one more question" - The acting? █████ Falk is very good as usual.
