Last year was the 200th anniversary of ███████ ██████'s birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species", so it's fitting that ███ █████'s "Creation" got released. The movie focuses on the period of ██████'s (████ ███████) life while he was writing his famous work, and the mild strain that it put on his family life.<br /><br />I guess that the movie overplayed ██████'s tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter █████, but I still like the thought of ██████'s theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma. As it was, the US was one of the last countries in which "Creation" found a distributor, due to the creationism-evolution debate (yes, it's still going on).<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a masterpiece, but I recommend it the same way that I recommend "Inherit the Wind". I hope that one day, the creationism-evolution debate won't be an issue. If this film helps put the debate to rest, then more power to everyone in the movie! Also starring ██████ ████, ██████ ███████, ████ █████ and ████████ ███████████.
