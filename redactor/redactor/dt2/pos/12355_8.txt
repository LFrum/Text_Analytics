█████ ████, is another ███ █████ Blaxploitation film. It was one of ███'s less visceral films of this genre. ███ plays █████ █████, who's a Chicago gumshoe. █████'s father is the owner of a small loan company, in Missouri. When local mobsters try to run her father of of business, █████ goes after the bad guys.<br /><br />███ █████ had already made her mark in Blaxploitation films, by the time █████ ████ came along. Fans of both Coffy and ████ █████, know that ███ is capable of an explosive intensity as an actress. In █████ ████, the fiery performance that viewers had come to expect from ███, wasn't as evident in this film. Not that ███ doesn't kick-butt in █████ ████. She's just not as much of a runaway-train vigilante, as she was in her previous Blaxploitation films.<br /><br />The supporting cast in this film, are a distinct disappointment. So █████ ████ is ███'s film, through and through. And though ███'s a bit more subdued than in her other films, she still gives a compelling performance in █████ ████. This film is definitely worth your time, if you're an ardent ███ █████ fan.
