The first music video I ever saw, ████████, my mom told me that she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived, my sister had MTV on the TV and ████████ was playing, my mom said that I smiled. Silly I know, but I have loved ███████ ███████ since that day, the music video ████████ inspired me to dance, still I have the dance memorized to this day. I even performed it for an audience 3 times! Words cannot describe the power of this song that makes you wanna sing and dance, but ███████ of course had to raise the bar for MTV at the time by signing on American Werewolf in London director ████ ██████ and directing the one, the only, ████████.<br /><br />███████ and his date, ███ ███, run out of gas in a dark, wooded area. They walk off into the forest, and ███████ asks her if she would like to go steady. She accepts and he gives her a ring. He warns her, however, that he is not like other guys, no really, not like the other guys. A full moon appears, and ███████ begins convulsing in agony  transforming into a horrifying werewolf! His date shrieks and runs away, but the werewolf catches up, knocking her down and begins lunging at her with its claws. The scene cuts away to a movie theater where ███████ and his date are actually watching this scene unfold in a movie called ████████. ███████ smiles but his date is frightened, and tells him she's leaving. ███████ catches up to her, and says that it's only a movie, but she doesn't like his jokes on her and she starts walking away. ███████ and his date then walk down a foggy street, and he teases her with the opening verses of ████████. They pass a graveyard, where corpses suddenly begin to rise from their graves as Vincent Price performs his rap. ███████ and his date then find themselves surrounded by the zombies, and suddenly, ███████ becomes a zombie himself. ███████ and the undead perform an elaborate song and dance number together, followed by the chorus of ████████.<br /><br />████████ is arguably the best music video of all time, funny thing is people who wanna argue that is with other ███████ ███████ videos, but what makes ████████ so special is the dance, the story, the effects, this at the time was the most expensive music video of it's day. ███████ of course rose that bar again with his famous music video ██████ and then again with Ghosts. But say what you will, ███████ was the star of the 1980's, there was no celebrity like him, he loved the life, he lived it, breathed it and embraced it. ████████ is proof that he was willing to work to make the best and that's what we got with the legend that is ████████.<br /><br />10/10
