"Lights of New York" originally started out as an experimental two reel Vitaphone short that eventually snowballed into the first all talkie feature film. ██████ ████████ was supposedly one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and sister to (in my opinion the real beauty) Dolores ████████, who seemed to get all the breaks. ████ ██████ is best known for appearing in this pretty dreary film that bought a revolution to Hollywood!!<br /><br />Two bootleggers on the lam in "████ ██████" convince a couple of small town barbers to try their luck on Broadway. The barbers █████ (██████ ██████) and Gene (██████ ███████) don't realise that their barber shop is soon a cover for illegal bootlegging activities. They soon do realise it and regret the day they left their small town. The only thing keeping them going is the loan that █████'s mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back. █████ becomes re-acquainted with █████ █████ (██████ ████████) a girl from his home town who has made good on Broadway. Kitty is worried about "Hawk" ██████ (███████ ██████) who is always hanging around her but █████, innocently, thinks she is exaggerating as "Hawk" already has a girlfriend █████ (██████ █████████) but to reassure her he gives her a little handgun to frighten unwanted admirers away. "Hawk", who has killed a police officer and has the "Feds" closing in, decides to frame █████. Meanwhile █████ is getting pretty fed up with "Hawks" treatment of her and after a showdown where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old hen the stage is set for - ██████!!!<br /><br />The fact is it isn't completely awful, apart from gangsters and showgirls alike speaking in their best elocution voices and that was still happening in films in 1930. ██████ █████████ (if a trifle melodramatic) and ██████ ███████ (quite natural) were okay and were the most seasoned actors in the cast. There was no ████ or █████ █████████ to be seen - ██████ ██████ and ██████ ████████ soon returned to the obscurity from which they had come. I also didn't notice much of the "hidden mike" - where people had to be grouped around different objects ie a telephone or sitting on a couch before they could engage in conversation. People who saw it at the cinema probably started to think that all policeman talked in that flat monotone as that trend continued in many early talkies ie "Little Caesar" (1930). In any case they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a completely all talkie - with some singing and dancing - film in 1928.<br /><br />Recommended.
