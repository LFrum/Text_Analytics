Let's face it, there is no perfect production of ██████, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of ███████████ ███████ and ███████████'s abstruse dialogue. In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with. I've seen a lot of filmed ██████ productions: ███████, ██████, ███████, █████, and now this BBC film with ██████. In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks up there with the very best.<br /><br />Most ██████ productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours. This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original ███████████ dialogue is intact -- and so it's essential for scholars and ███████████-lovers. And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well-acted, well-spoken, and well-performed. Subtitles are available and very helpful, although upon occasion they lag slightly behind.<br /><br />██████ does a quite admirable job with theatre's longest and most impossible role. I actually cried when ██████ dies, and I don't think I've done that before. ███████ Stewart (as ████████) and ██████ █████ (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are █████ ████ (Ophelia) and █████ ████ (Laertes), and the rest of the very on-point cast. Sets are minimal, so we can thankfully concentrate on the play without distraction or attention paid to non-essentials.<br /><br />At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length ██████ is a long haul to sit through, but again, if you want the real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if one needs to take an intermission for oneself. I highly recommend this production to all ███████████ lovers and scholars.
