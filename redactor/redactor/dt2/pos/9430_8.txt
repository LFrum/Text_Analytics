Dr. █████ █████, a Swiss scientist, is smuggled out of his home country by Sherlock ██████ in order that the Nazi agents spying him do not get his invention of a new bomb sight. Arriving in London, he takes residence with ██████ and ██████, but goes out for a visit with his girlfriend, █████████ ██████, where he leaves a clue for ██████ as to the locations of his bomb sight, which he has divided into four pieces, but ██████' eternal nemesis, █████████ █████████, is also seeking the bomb sight to sell to the Nazis, and abducts Dr. Tobel and the clue left at Charlotte's, a code series of dancing men, which both ██████ and Moriarity are both unable to decipher completely. ██████ eventually discovers the clue to the code and get the location of the fourth piece of the bomb sight, but Moriarity has the other three and a showdown is inevitable. Very good entry in the ██████ series with plenty of mystery and guesswork to go about. ██████'s portrayal of Moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning sort described in the Doyle stories (or ██████ █████'s performance in The Adventures of Sherlock ██████), but ██████'s skills as an actor makes his Moriarity quite the benevolent fellow. The script and direction both make this entry more of a cat and mouse game between the two characters and that is one of the reasons this entry succeeds so well. Great job on the cinematography as well. Rating, 8.
