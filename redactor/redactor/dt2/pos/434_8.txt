Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by █████ ████) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.<br /><br />Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting, but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets.<br /><br />Consider it ████ ██████'s love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the ████ ██████ film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions.<br /><br />
