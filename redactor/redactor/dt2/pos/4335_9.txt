This is an incredibly fun action/exploitation 80s rocker. ███████ ███████ rules as ████ ██████. The villains are hilariously bad. The soundtrack, by █████ ████ is laughably bad. ████ Winter (████ of ████ & Ted) is great as one of the street punks who gets wasted by ███████ and crew. Crew? Oh, those are the downtrodden townsfolk who team up with ███████ to win back the streets. The whole movie is enjoyable, with the last half hour or so exploding into non-stop action and mayhem. 9/10
