███████ is some kind of saint,he wants to live in life exactly how ██████ taught man to do.But it's too late:now the Catholic Church is between the hands of a wealthy bourgeoisie,the bishops live in luxury and don't give a damn about the poor and the sick.That's why our hero can't follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow.So he divests himself of everything,and on his way to purity,he's joined by some kind of ████ █████████ and a woman who's attracted by him sexually (the scene between this girl and her fiancé is telling).In Spain (it was the late fifties),they thought ███████ was a ██████ian movie!Knowing ████ ██████,it was downright incongruous:all his work is anticlerical to a fault.Comparing ███████ and his "holy women" to █████ is a nonsense.On ███████'s way,only brambles and couch grass grow.His attempt at helping working men on the road is a failure,he's chased out as a strike-breaker.All his words amount to nothing.At the end of the journey,he's arrested and offered a pineapple by a woman(██████ian sexual symbol). Thanks to "███████" ,██████ was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors had not got a clue ) and to direct "Viridiana".
