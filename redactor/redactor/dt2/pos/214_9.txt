I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named ████ was shot twice. <br /><br />But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episode's title was different from the one shown on the screen. <br /><br />██████ ███████'s portrayal of █████ ██████ was deadpan, yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of ████ ████ of Dragnet. ████ North did well and █████ █████, in one of his few roles since Mission: ██████████ wasn't bad as Norberg, But the one character that stood out was ██████ the Shoeshine Boy, played by ███████ █████. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos from ████ █████, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then ██████ manager █████ ███████. <br /><br />Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise. I'll close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the ending right here.
