"The Desperadoes" (1943) is a genuine classic, not for its story (which is fairly routine), but for its technical production elements. This was a landmark western, the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a ████████ production-a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation. Only ███'s "█████ █████" (also starring ████████ █████) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre. Although it would be eclipsed in a few years by "The Searchers" and "High Noon", "The Desperadoes" was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure. <br /><br />In 1863, the economy in the town of Red ██████, ████ is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in ████'s future) and ██████'s Last Stand (██████ was busy fighting ██████ in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements. <br /><br />Red ██████ has an honest sheriff, █████ █████ (█████), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses. The town is visited by ████████ ██████ (█████ ████), a famous outlaw who is an old friend █████'s. He wants to go straight, especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner ██████ ██████ (██████ █████). Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" ████████) is mainly there for comic relief as are █████ ██████ McLeod (█████ ████████) and the town judge (███████ ███████ who models his character on █████ ██████'s "██████ of Oz" crystal ball faker). <br /><br />Taking no chances with their huge budget ████████ packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered wagons. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a spectacular barroom brawl, an explosive climax, romance, and three-strip Technicolor. All this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. <br /><br />The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming. The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. <br /><br />█████ and ██████ ██████ were top billed, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, who would soon be their biggest star. And ████████ ███████ █████ utilized the film to showcase his new wife █████ (whose portrayal of ████████'s sister in "Gone With the Wind" had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films). <br /><br />The Ford-█████ dynamic is "The Desperadoes" most unique and important feature. Rather than go for the cliché "love triangle" with █████ and/or Trevor (which it first appears will happen), the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role █████ ever got and she makes the most of it. Playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like █████ █████████'s character in "Pirates of the Caribbean". This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the WAAC for WWII military service. <br /><br />"The Desperadoes" is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new. Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
