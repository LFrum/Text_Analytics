I hate to admit it, but I didn't find it to be one of █████████'s best but nonetheless a riveting, climatic thriller. In a remake of Hitchock's 1934 movie of the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna (█████ ███████)  the man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (█████ Day) are holidaying in Morocco with their son Hank (███████████ █████) when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot. The conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot: kidnapping their beloved Hank.<br /><br />I found it surprising that █████ Day, who I usually associate with ████ ██████ comedies, was cast in a █████████ film. As I was watching it, I soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to █████████'s other works (example: Psycho) and she had singing ability needed to pull off "Que Sera Sera", which she did beautifully. She was well cast as herself and █████ ███████ had chemistry, which helped make the couple believable.<br /><br />In comparison to the great director's other works I believe this isn't as good, but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller/mystery. There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a smash hit for █████ Day. Well directed, well acted. A fine film.
