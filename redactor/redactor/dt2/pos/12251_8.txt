This is a love story set against the back drop of television news. The three main stars, ███████ ████,█████ ██████ and ██████ ██████ create a love triangle whilst working at the Washington bureau of a TV network.<br /><br />███ ███████(Hurt)is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star.████ (██████)is the producer who recognises that ███ lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway.Aaron Altman(Brooks)is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her.<br /><br />█████ ██████ was nominated for a Best Actress ███████ █████ ,but lost out to Cher(Moonstruck!).She was robbed! This is ██████'s film.Her character ████ is smart,ruthless and totally driven. She is also hilariously neurotic. Her performance is perfect.Just watch her face when she watches the tape of ███'s interview of a rape victim. The scales literally fall from her eyes.<br /><br />██████ ████'s performance is less showy.He plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud,but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like ████.He gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating.<br /><br />The film comments on celebrity, journalism,integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. It predicted that news would be dumbed down, that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures.<br /><br />Think about this:this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before rise of reality TV.Yet, it predicted the dumbing down of the news.Paris ██████'s release from jail was treated like a major news story! To see how prophetic this film is,just watch your evening news and note the set, the graphics and the presenters.███ ███████ and his clones are well and truly alive!
