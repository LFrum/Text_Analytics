█████████ Muthamittal is for sure a great movie. I have to give it to ████ ██████ for a great directing job and A.R. ██████ for great songs. The camera work is just excellent and is similar to █████ ████ ████ and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for ████ ███████ ████ or even ████ ██████ ████.
