The third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant Exploitation movies, and the third masterpiece in a row, "██████ ██████: Kemono-beya" aka. "██████ ████████ Scorpion: █████ ██████" (aka. "██████: Den Of The Beast" where I live) of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects, but that equals (or arguably even surpasses) them in brilliance. The entire original ██████ series with the wonderful █████ ████ stands out as the absolute highlight in WIP cinema, and all of the films, especially the first three, uniquely combine Exploitation and Art-house cinema like no other movie does. "█████ ██████" is the third, and second-to-last "██████" film with █████ ████, the last one to be directed by genius director ██████ ███ and, in my opinion, the greatest of them all. The first film "Joshuu 701-gô: ██████" of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of Exploitation cinema and simply THE Definition of Exploitation-Art. In the equally brilliant first sequel, "██████ ██████: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô" ███ added more surrealism and symbolism. The third "██████" film, "█████ ██████" keeps up the surrealism (allthough not quite to the same extent as the second), and features even more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics like poverty, forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie. <br /><br />This third "██████" film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the, generally brilliant, cycle (to me it's this one, with the first one as a close second). Once again, "Best Stable" is both very artistic and very Exploitation-like. The visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again, as well as sequences of enormous surrealistic beauty. The stunningly beautiful █████ ████ is once again brilliant in her role of ████ ██████████ (aka. ██████). I absolutely worship this wonderful actress, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do so. The rest of the performances are also great, especially █████ ██████ is great as a police Inspector who is obsessed with catching ██████. The musical score is the same throughout all three films, with "Urami-Bushi", sung by █████ ████ herself, as the main theme, which is great, since the score is, simply put, pure perfection. As its predecessors, "█████ ██████" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss. The entire ██████-cycle ranges high on my personal all-time favorite list. "█████ ██████" is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all! 10/10
