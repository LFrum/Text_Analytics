The ████████ Children is the second best ████████ movie in the ████████ series.I saw the original The ████████ Wives in the theater when it came out in 1975.I was absolutely blown away,it was terrific.I have seen all of the ████████ movies, and I like all of them.I think that The ████████ Children is such a campy and fun movie.I just watched it again recently on tape, and I enjoyed it immensely.The cast in this movie was real good to watch. ███████ ████ did a bang up job as usual.Every role that she has ever played has been very good.███████ ████ is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of person.Don Murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this movie.He was particularly effective at being the irritated father to his two teenage children.I made sure that I have all of the ████████ movie on tape to enjoy.If you get a chance to see this movie you should.
