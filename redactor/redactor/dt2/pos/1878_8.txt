an awesome made for the sci-fi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts they've churned out. █████ ████████ is on superb form as a possible investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professor,██████ █████,and his half-wit assistance,███ █████. The film is pure b movie gold and its great to see █████ and ram up on screen with █████, and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on █████'s comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious, and makes me ask the question, why isn't this guy getting more of his scripts commissioned?, it indeed a sick world. Definitely worth a watch.
