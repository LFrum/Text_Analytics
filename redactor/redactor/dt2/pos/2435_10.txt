This amusing, sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars ██████ █████ as an unnamed former cop who retires, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, ████████ ██████, then sets up shop as a private eye under the name "███ ███████". ██████ Sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right; more to the point, the body and facial language are there. For awhile, "███"'s only client is his landlady, who wants him to find her undersized boyfriend, and his only conversational foil is his secretary, simply called "Dutchess" (█████ ████), who in his own words, "looked like ███████ ██████ and made about as much sense as ██████ █████", and has a passion for banana splits. Then he encounters ████ (██████ ██████), the plain, sweet, virginal daughter of a retired props-master who has been murdered for no discernible reason. In the process of investigating the murder, ███ shortly runs across: the Gene Tierney lookalike daughter (Michelle Phillips) of ███████, an avaricious, obscenely wealthy Greek shipping tycoon (██████ █████, turning in a creditable ██████ ███████████), his hapless, long-suffering second wife (Yvonne deCarlo, who manages to play a variety of put-upon emotions without saying a word), his two smarmy henchmen (███████ ███, channelling █████ █████, and ███ ████████, doing a reasonably accurate Lionel Atwill), and ███████' vicious, amoral Middle-Eastern potentate (██████ ████) who comes complete with a glamorus and bafflingly loyal mistress (█████ ███████), all of whom would give anything to acquire the "Eyes of █████████", two huge, perfectly matched star sapphires. When ████ is murdered, ███████'s interest in solving the case becomes personal, and he sets out through a labyrinth of Los Angeles landmarks, including the Hollywood Bowl, the scatological and esoteric attractions of █████████ █████████, and █████ ████████ ██████ in pursuit of the rocks, determined to get at them before either of the two wealthy competitors. Throw in cameos by ████ ███████ and assorted others, the traditional dumb-but-sympathetic ally on the police force, and a plethora of nicely drawn character turns that provide dimension to practically all players, and despite an unfortunate title song, you have, to my mind, a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.
