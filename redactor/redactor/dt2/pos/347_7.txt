I love just about everything the late ██ ███████ directed in his long and varied career, but "The Possession of █████ ██████" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like "Horror of the Blood Monsters" and "███████ Vs. Frankenstein". This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch "█████ ██████"? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements from "The Exorcist", "Ruby", and "██████" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies. You can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it, but the film drips with atmosphere. (And what an ending! Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you.) ███████ and producer ███ ███████ really nailed it with this one, and it doesn't matter whether "█████ ██████" was a calculated success or a happy accident. ████ ████████ is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (████ ███, who shines in his brief role). ████████ Land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing. "█████ ██████" was a Poverty Row production, and it shows at times (sets, special effects, etc.). Still, the film has heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some genuine chills. ███ ███████ also saw fit to use █████ █████'s theme music for the late '50s/early '60s television series "One ████ ██████" in this film, which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of T&A that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer, the TV spot, and a great commentary by ███████. Does anybody know whatever happened to ████ ███, by the way? Next to ████ █████████, he's the best actor I've ever seen in an ██ ███████ film, and he plays the cult leader like he means it.
