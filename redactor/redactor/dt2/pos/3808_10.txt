This is an entertaining surreal road movie. It was written by ██████ ██████, who also wrote After █████, ██████ ████████'s excellent surreal film. The film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old kid named ███, who drives a red Ford ███████ across some fictional states with names like Tristana (A tribute to ████ ██████'s film, perhaps?), █████ & South Lyndon, in search of eight elusive Motorama game cards from various Chimera Company gas stations. The film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual, like the money for instance, which is like blank paper with numbers on.<br /><br />Most of the characters are nasty to ███ on his trip. They tattoo him, punch him, but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest. Some oddball actors like █████ █████ incumbent ████ █████, ████ ████ & ████ also make appearances. ████ █████ plays a motel owner, who when he first meets ███ tells him, "If you see any squirrels, give them to me". This is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes ███ $100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely. If you're a fan of ████ █████ and surreal movies, you'll like this. An odd little gem of a movie.
