The four signs on the road say "If You're Looking For ███.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's ██████ ██████!"<br /><br />In the woods, we see hundreds of "██████ ██████" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to ████ █████'s hole. Who's putting up all these signs? █████ Duck!<br /><br />█████ puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, "Awfully unsporting of me, I know. But, what the hey - I gotta have some fun! Besides, it's really duck season."<br /><br />From that point, we now see █████ ████, shotgun in hand.....and a war of semantics between ████ and █████ with ████ winning every time. Only in cartoons, thankfully, can we see someone getting shotgun-blasted in the head five times and keep going!
