I found this to be an underrated, quietly compelling █████████ ███████ (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE). Despite modest credentials (apart from multi-purpose co-writer/producer ██████ ████, the only notable crew member is composer █████ ███████████), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (newcomer ████ ████ is an ambiguous anti-hero, while veterans ██████ ███████ and ██████ ████ lend a mythic quality to the proceedings) as well as the unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering a strategic clean-up of the town, and which has the law finally siding with the gunfighter against a horde of Mexican bandits).<br /><br />There are several tough action scenes on hand  the film is capped by a terrific climax in which the star trio is besieged inside a blazing cabin  plus a couple of outrageous moments which are something of a █████████ ███████ trademark: from the middle of the street, ████ sees a hidden gunman at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle; a man who helps ████ escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains. █████████ Machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom ████ lodges; the supporting cast, then, is peppered with familiar (if largely anonymous) faces  all of them essentially genre fixtures.<br /><br />I wasn't aware of the fact that the English-dubbed version of the film on MGM/UA's R1 DVD was cut: I was fooled by the wrong running-time being listed on the back-cover; the film was only 99 minutes long and not 118  apparently, ████'s character is killed in the longer Italian version!
