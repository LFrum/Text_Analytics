Cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it, but (based on the many literate comments) actually GET IT! I for one have always considered ████ ████████'s "Tempest" a musing on the Shakespeare play of the same name, as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here. On the other hand, if you're looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play, you should look elsewhere. As an experiment, however, it succeeds just spectacularly. Charming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all of that and much more. Cast, locations, script, music are just fantastic. ██████████ and ███████ were never better. █████ ████████'s turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future. Molly ████████ makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love ████ █████'s performance ... he steals the show in several scenes. What's more, the always great ██████████ was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him! A study on what the thematic elements of Shakespeare's classic might be life if updated into more "modern times," ████████'s "Tempest" burns brilliantly!
