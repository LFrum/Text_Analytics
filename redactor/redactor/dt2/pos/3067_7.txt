███ Brooks is a great writer,director and actor, but once in a while even he can have a klinker. The beginning of this starts out almost basically just meeting one character after another.You have ████ █████ who's charming and talented, but he can't do comedy. His expressions into the camera show that even he can't believe the inanities in the script. ███████ █████ looks bored and distracted throughout without much to do and ███ ███████ is stuck in high-school acting mode. ████ Chapelle shows great comedy range mugging and hamming for the camera and ████ ██████████ is mostly stifled in the role of the blind man, but then he does still manage to show great comedy range. ████ █████ ██████ doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he does have are binding. The best roles are those of █████ ████, █████ ██████, █████ █████████ and Brooks for when he does appear. ███ DeLuise has a funny turn as a Mafia Don employing a █████ ████████ lookalike, but on the minus side, some of the jokes aren't very funny while some of the really funny ones seem stolen from ███'s other movies.
