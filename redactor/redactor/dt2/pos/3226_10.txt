This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. ██████ Graham is perfect as ███████ ███████, a single mother who is ████'s best friend. ██████ Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent ████ ███████ and █████ █████ is one of a kind as ████'s best friend, ████ ███. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. █████ Bishop is wicked great as █████ ███████ and ██████ ███████ is terrific as ███████ ███████. █████ █████████ is a joy as ████ █████ and the band members are one of a kind to watch. The Community, ████ █████, ███████, Mrs. ███, ██████ █████, ████ and other's are always laugh out loud funny, quirky and interesting that always makes the snappy one-liners stand out. This show has changed so much over the years that it won't ever get old. ███████ Girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching. That is how good it is. I give this show a 10/10 rating.
