I love this show. My girlfriend was gonna get an abortion until we both watched ██████ ███████ one night. Luckily, she killed herself before the baby was born. Though technically I think it was considered a murder-suicide.<br /><br />My first thoughts upon seeing ██████ ███████? Now I know what God watches when He jerks off all the time.<br /><br />██████ ███████ is to television what a toaster in the bathtub is to my self-esteem.<br /><br />You know how ██████ ██ ████ makes speaking gaffes all the time? █████ wouldn't. █████'s good. █████ cuts his nails. He's █████. He's good. Tyyyllerrr...
