This is one of the funniest movies I've ever saw. A 14-year old boy █████ ████████ wrote an English paper called "███ ███ ████". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. When he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from Hollywood, █████ ████. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So █████ ████ took it and he turned █████'s English paper into a movie! When █████ admitted that he left his paper in the limo and █████ took it, his parents and his English teacher didn't believe him! So █████ and his friend ██████ had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to make █████ admit he stole his story to █████'s parents. When █████ told █████ to call his dad that █████ stole that paper, █████ tricked him and burned his paper! █████ got so angry that █████ burned that paper so █████ called security to get █████ out of his site! █████ and ██████ realized █████ isn't going to admit the truth. In order to take █████ down in Phase 2: The Takedown, █████ and ██████ put permanent blue dye into the pool and when █████ jumps in, his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off! Then they put permanent orange dye in █████'s shampoo and when he uses it, his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too! Finally, they put lots of glue on █████'s earpiece to make him call █████'s father and when █████ uses it, it sticks to his ear! It was funny when █████'s hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear! After that, they tricked █████ by telling █████, who is █████'s assistant, that Duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on. When █████ went in to see Duncan, he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When █████ was in the house, █████ and ██████ switched the controls of his car. When █████ drove his car, he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push. He's stupid enough to fall for it. When █████ hit the rear end of the masher, the masher wrecked his car! It was so funny. So █████ starts to call █████'s dad and tricked him again! He was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called security! After the security got █████ and ██████ out of █████'s site, they suggested them to go home. █████ was going to be on █████ and ██████'s side cause she knew that █████ was a liar and a jerk so she told █████, who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids. █████ told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to L.A. When █████ came to the kids, she's going to help the kids move into Phase 4: The Payback. █████ splits the crew into 3 teams for Phase 4. One team will distract and trick █████ until █████'s parents get to the set. █████ first rode with █████ ███████, but his car broke down so he rode with ██████, but he took him into the desert and leave him there. When █████ was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. After that, one of the blades are jammed so █████ and the pilot got off the helicopter. After that, he was on the way to the set and when █████ saw him, █████ stopped and saw what █████ has: his monkey! So █████ went after █████ and ██████ and when they saw ██████, he released the water and when the water came, it pushed █████ away. █████ was still after the kids and when ██████ went the other way, █████ led █████ to the top of the apartment building. At the top, █████ was challenging █████ by making him admit the truth and █████ will never ever tell the truth. When the crew caught █████ in surprise, all the people including █████'s parents who were at the set knew what █████ did. █████ was going to kill █████ but the only way for █████ to escape is jump down from the top! After that, his parents believed him that █████ took his story. When the people who were on the set left, this is the end of █████. At the end, █████'s story, ███ ███ ████ was a movie. I cant get enough of it.
