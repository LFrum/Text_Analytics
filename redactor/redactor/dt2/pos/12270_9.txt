This was a really nice surprise. I was up late last night and couldn't fall asleep. Not really thinking twice, I turned on my TV and HBO was on, and this film was just beginning. Luckily I saw the whole thing, and I am very happy I did. Because this film was very good. The actors were well-cast, and they did a surprisingly good job. ████ █████████████ delivered a solid performance, there was a lot of substance behind his lines. This film made me realize he's a good actor. Brian █████ was great as his father, as was ████ ██████ playing the Colonel (this was ████ ██████'s final role before his untimely death. Too bad, he was a quality actor and seemed like a nice guy). ██████ ████████ also did a nice job as █████████████'s American wife. As far as the direction, I had no idea ████████ ██ █████████ was the director until I read the review in ███████ ██████'s █████ █████(this was the last film he ever made). Now I understand why this movie was so good. █████████ also directed ██████, a truly great movie(I haven't seen his other great film, Papillon). While I was watching "███████ ████", I said to myself, "this director really knows what he's doing," not knowing that █████████ had directed it. There's one really beautiful scene in a Thai orphan refuge, enough to bring tears to my eyes. Not only was this sensitively directed, but it was also directed in a very economical and taut way. There is nothing wasted in █████████'s effort. The script was one reason this film is so good. The writer doesn't weigh the actors down with too many lines. It was written very simply but very effectively. It just shows you that a lot can be said with few words. This film also made me proud to be an American, at the same time that it showed you how beautiful ALL people are.
