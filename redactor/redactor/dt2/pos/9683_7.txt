Despite the apparent structural similarity with The Simpsons - loud fat dad, housewifey mum, 3 children, a pet, typical suburban home, ██████ ███ is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to The Simpsons. Its avid use (and sometimes too much) of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail on the head (The Rhea Perlman and █████ ██████ bit in Season 5 is spine-snappingly hilarious), others are less successful, coming across as contrived. And they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the story line. (The Jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting)<br /><br />The chemistry between ██████ and █████ ███████ lends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that █████ and ███ only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family.<br /><br />However, the feature film ██████ ███████: The Untold Story, is MINDNUMBINGLY horrible. Thank goodness it went straight to DVD.<br /><br />Contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, ████ ██████████'s approach with ██████ ███ is actually very different - it's much more politically incorrect, and amazingly, a lot more brazen.<br /><br />Creator of ███ and Stimpy, ████ ██████████, famously criticized ██████ ███ for having "extremely low" graphic standards from a cartoonist's standpoint. I don't think it looks that bad though, the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful.<br /><br />All in all, a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in ranch sauce and ass jokes.
