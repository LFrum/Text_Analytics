█████ █████'s 1995 commercial hit & now cult-classic 'Tommy ███' is a hilarious film, an evergreen entertainer. █████ ██████ is a talent which we'll never ever forget!!! <br /><br />'Tommy ███' is a simple story, told in the funniest & zany way possible. ██████ & Spade take a journey which is filled with unstoppable laughter, even the Rob Lowe portion is damn funny. As a kid, I remember watching 'Tommy ███' again and again and again. It's been of my childhood favorites, and it will always remain to be. Even today when it comes on T.V. I stick to it as a die-hard fan. I am quite possessive about this film. <br /><br />█████'s direction is super. █████ ██████ might have died in 1997, but remains alive for me, at least. What an actor! Watch his work in 'Tommy ███', he's so much at ease. He delivered fantastic performances later on in films like 'Berverly █████ █████' & 'Almost ██████', but his work in here remains as his best to date! Love you, ██████! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He's an excellent actor in all respects! <br /><br />'Tommy ███' rules.... 100 thumbs up from this writer!
