The movie is a very good movie.one of the best from ████ raj films.The direction is incredible.The screenplay is brilliant.The story is excellent.It tells about █████ who is obssed of Kiran his college friend.He is a full blown psycho doing things like talking to his mother on a phone(anyway she died 15 years back) etc.Kiran is engaged to Sunil.█████ does everything so he can get her.He even trys to kill Sunil but he survives it.He even goes to the place where they are going to their honeymoon.The movie is every nes delight.Shahrukh is superb,████ is fairly good,█████ is average,███████ is okay and so is █████,█████ did good.The movie belongs to Srk.The dialogues are brilliant(Shahrukh ones and a lot if not the overacting and comedy)."█████ ████ █████" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodious tracks.
