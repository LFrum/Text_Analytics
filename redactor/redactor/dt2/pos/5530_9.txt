That was one of the lines in a trailer about this film and for once the publicists did not exaggerate. All six of the featured players here are on the screen 99% of the time, so they have to be good.<br /><br />It's always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked for either highballing comedy to a deadly serious situation. ████ Boland of the ditzy and ███████ ███████ of the henpecked play their usual characters who are planning to motor all the way to California. To share expenses they advertise for someone to share the ride. They get █████ and █████ and a monster of a dog. That same premise was a deadly serious one several generations later in Kalifornia.<br /><br />Of course if you're traveling with ██████ █████ you know you're going to be going absolutely nuts trying to figure her █████ ███████████ reasoning about the whole world. And if that ain't enough you get to run into W.C. Fields, part time sheriff and full time pool hustler who's living in sin with ██████ █████████. But back then we didn't delve into such things.<br /><br />A real classic comedy from the thirties, not to be missed.
