For the most part, romance films were never my cup of tea. But ██████ ████ is one of the few romance films I not only could sit through, but actually enjoy. ████████ Cage is great in his first role and ███████ ███████ is cute beyond belief. There are some side stories that tend to become muddled, but not enough to diminish this film.
