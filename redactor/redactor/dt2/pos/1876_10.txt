OK, well, no one in their right mind(s) would pick up a movie titled "The Man with the Screaming █████" and expect it to be serious. This is an outrageous b-movie, and that means a truly hokey plot, strange characters, clichés, over-the-top action, and oh-so-cheesy one liners. For that odd segment of the population (including myself) that gets a kick out of that kind of thing, this is a gem.<br /><br />The acting is better than expected. █████ Keach is embedded in his character. █████ ████████ brings a spirited, convincing performance. His physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this movie and hearken back to the "████ ████" films.
