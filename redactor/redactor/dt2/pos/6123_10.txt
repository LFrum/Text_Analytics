I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to the films of ████ ██████, since I was way too young to watch them. And if you're knowledge of ████ ██████ is limited to █████████ or Cry-Baby, or other family friendly movies, then you must prepare yourself for ████ Flamingos.<br /><br />Explicit sex acts, incest, an old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and unsanitary acts with chickens are just a mere portion of some of the depravity in this movie. The film ends with ██████, ██████' 300 lbs. cross-dressing star eating dog excrement.<br /><br />The premise is about two families: One a pair of inbred trailer trash, which includes ██████ and █████ ██████ as the egg lady; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. Both families are competing for the title of "Filthiest person alive." █████ ████ ██████' finest movie, but only see it if you're an open-minded individual with a strong stomach, because some scenes in this movie will gross you out.
