All-Monster congregation in the final film in Universal's renowned cycle of classic horror stories. █████ Dracula (an intense, dapper ████ █████████), calling himself █████ █████, comes to Dr. Edelmann (██████ ███████) asking to be cured of his affliction. Naturally, this is just a ruse. Then, coincidentally, █████ ██████ (Lon Chaney), a.k.a. "The Wolf Man", shows up and of course he *really* wants to be cured.<br /><br />As others have noted, the monsters don't get equal screen time. The Frankenstein Monster (█████ ███████) gets thrown in at the end just for the purpose of including all of the Universal Monsters. Stock footage and library music are re-used here as well. The film spends maybe a little too much time with the Dracula part of the story, although █████████ gives an impressive, non-hammy performance in the role of the █████. The film is mainly a showcase for ███████, who goes through a tragic character arc of his own, and does an excellent job. The women are gorgeous, and I have to say that I loved ████ █████ as the luminous nurse - who happens to be hunchbacked.<br /><br />Of course, it wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers.<br /><br />Competently, professionally made chiller is, just for my tastes, not really scary at all, but entertaining regardless. It's a respectable series entry overall.<br /><br />7/10
