It was a movie that made ya think a little. Some parts a little cheesy, some parts pretty good. ████ did thicken at times and just when you thought ███████ (Sandra) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead. All I got to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap ███████ went through. He would have lifted me and ███████ through the dumps.
