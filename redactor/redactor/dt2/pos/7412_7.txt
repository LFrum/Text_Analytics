I just saw this movie in a sneak preview and before reading my comment you have to know that it is very subjective because I love ██████, Trance, ████, House and music like that.<br /><br />The movie deals with ████, whose brother █████ (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell off a rooftop, "drunk". ████ meets his brother's girlfriend █████ and the two of them quite unmotivated some kind of private investigation about █████'s death and ████ gets involved in █████'s ex-life that was filled with clubs and drugs. The movie itself, seen from an artistic point of view, is nothing more than a big pile of s**t. The plot is predictable, all of the characters are extremely cliched and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town, young good-looking innocent girl, big bad drug king... the list is endless) and most of the acting such as the plot are just not credible. ███████ Rhys' performance of the stupid boy coming to big London and sudden taking drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very credible, unlike his female counterpart █████, performed by ██████ ████████, whose behaviour seems more realistic to the spectator. Nothing more than a joke was ███ █████'s performance of the drug king Damian: a phony caricature, too "eeeevil" and just too ridiculous to be true.<br /><br />BUT: If you like club music (the club scenes such as the selected tracks are simply brilliant), if you enjoy a simple lovestory with a sweet girl like █████ (yes, I confess, I lost my heart ;)... that makes my comment even more subjective, I guess) with some (predictable) twists and turns you will definetely enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Anybody else: F.O.R.G.E.T.....I.T.!<br /><br />3 out of 10 (objective view)<br /><br />7 out of 10 (my personal view and also my final vote)
