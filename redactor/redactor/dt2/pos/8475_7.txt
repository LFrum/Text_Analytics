Recent years have seen a number of biopics of famous singers, and "Ray", the story of ███ ███████, has much in common with "Walk the Line" which was made the following year and told the story of ██████ ████. ████ and ███████ were near-exact contemporaries, both being born in the early thirties and dying in 2003/04. Both grew up in poverty in the American Deep South. Both lost a brother in an accident during childhood. Both achieved success in the 1950s. Both experienced problems in their marriages, and both were addicted to drugs. All these matters are emphasised in both films. There are also similarities with ███ ██████'s "A Beautiful Mind". Although that film was about a mathematician rather than a musician, it, like both "Ray" and "Walk the Line", stressed the part played by its subject's wife in helping her husband to overcome his problems.<br /><br />███ ███████ was born to a single mother in a poor black community in Georgia in 1930. (His original name was ███████ ███████ ████████, but when he was starting his career as a musician he dropped his surname to avoid confusion with the boxer █████ ███ ████████). In some ways ███████ had an even harder time than did ████, having to cope with two additional disadvantages in the shape of his blindness and of the racism which affected all black Americans, especially in the South, during his lifetime. ███████ had a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother ██████ in a drowning accident and going blind about a year or two later. He appears to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over ██████'s death throughout his life.<br /><br />The first half of the film is rather slow moving and is a standard rags-to-riches showbiz biopic, telling the story of how the young ███████ is taught to play the piano, becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as a major artist, falling in love along the way with the beautiful █████ ███. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to ███████'s childhood. There is an effective recurrent image of coloured glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind. There is also a memorable scene in which the teenaged ███████ shames a prejudiced bus driver into letting him on the bus by pretending to have lost his sight on Omaha beach (In reality he would only have been thirteen at the time of the Normandy landings).<br /><br />The second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory, focusing on ███████'s drug addiction, the problems in his marriage caused by his affair with ██████ █████████, one of his backing singers, and his battles against racism. In the early sixties ███████ caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a racially segregated audience in Georgia (although, contrary to what is stated in the film, this did not result in his being banned from performing in the state). He also fought against racial divides within the music industry itself, performing not only traditionally "black" styles of music such as gospel and rhythm and blues, but also traditionally "white" ones such as country and western (regarded by many black Americans as the music of choice of the redneck community).<br /><br />As █████ ████████, film critic of "The Guardian", noted "Ray" is a sunny film which diplomatically turns away from the darker side of things. It omits any mention of such matters as the death of ███████'s beloved mother ██████ during his teenage years, his brief marriage to ██████ ████████ in the early fifties and his eventual divorce from █████ ███ in 1977. It also plays down the extent of his womanising and the number of his illegitimate children. There are similarities here with "A Beautiful Mind" which also omitted a number of controversial details about its subject's personal life, including a divorce.<br /><br />Fans of ███ ███████ will no doubt enjoy the film for the music, but it is worth watching even for those who do not know much about him, chiefly on account of █████ ████'s Oscar-winning performance in the title role, reproducing ███████'s mannerisms so exactly that we think we actually are watching a blind man, even though ████ himself is sighted. (Unlike ███████ ███████ in "Walk the Line", however, ████ did not do his own singing- doubtless ███████'s distinctive singing voice was too difficult to reproduce). He receives good support from some of the other performers, particularly ██████ ██████ as ██████ and █████ ██████████ as █████ ███. The film is uneven and overlong, but nevertheless rewarding. 7/10
