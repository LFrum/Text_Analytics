While all of the █████████/Famous Studios "████████" cartoons are excellent, "███████ ██████ ███████," the third in the series, is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation, plot, and pacing. Why it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar as ████ ████████ █████ for 1942 (Incredibly enough, only the first one was) in inexplicable.<br /><br />Here, ████ ████ is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the U.S. Mint. Masked gangsters in their super-powered (for 1942) car take off after the train, determined to get that gold. Without giving too much away, what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience, with truth, justice, and ████████ triumphant at the end.<br /><br />As they did in all the █████████/Famous ████████ cartoons, ███████ "Bud" ███████ and ████ █████████, who played █████ Kent/████████ and ████ ████ on radio, have the voice work honors here, and █████████ perennial ████ ██████ gets a little to do as one of the bad guys, as well.
