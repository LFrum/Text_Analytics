Soul's Midnight stars ███████ ███████ (█████) who stared in "The Mambo Kings" and █████████ ███████ (██████ ███████). Together with ████ vampire vixen, ██████ ████ (████), █████ lures pregnant ██████ and her husband ███████ into the netherworld of Soul's Midnight. Assante sinks his fangs into the script by writers Brian and █████ █████████ and you enjoy watching him and ████ kill. ██████ and ███████ (██████ █████) try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood sated.<br /><br />(spoiler alert) In today's jaded landscape, it comes as no surprise that a back-stabbing preacher gets bitten. Set looks cool  lots of detail at the Borgo Hotel and cool special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie  it doesn't take itself too seriously and looks great.
