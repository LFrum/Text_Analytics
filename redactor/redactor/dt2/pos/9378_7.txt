██████ ███████ directed this shadowy movie about a murder investigation involving demobilized military personnel. ██████ Young gets to lecture us about hatred, ██████ ███████ walks through most of this picture, and ██████ ███████ revisits the feistiness she exhibited in "It's A Wonderful Life." It's ██████ ████ who gets at the heart of the matter: anti-semiticism. He goes so deep into his role as █████ ██████████ (Imagine parents named Lawrence calling their son █████!), that the drama sits squarely on his shoulders, and he is more than up to the challenge. Without him, the movie would be commonplace. Ryan has played a number of memorable villains in his day ("Bad Day at Black Rock;" "█████ ████"), but this performance put him on the map. With ███ ██████ as the murder victim.
