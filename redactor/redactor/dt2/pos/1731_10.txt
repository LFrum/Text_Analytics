Doctor Who is amazing. It is everyones 'cup of tea'. It must be. The boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around. <br /><br />██████ █████ was extraordinary as ████ █████. She was so emotional and made ████ so real.<br /><br />█████ ███████ is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />But now ██████ has left and ████ is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend ██████ and her mother and father (he died when ████ was a baby but this Pete █████ is from the Parallel universe). It will be very strange with ██████ being the new companion, as I have only ever seen it with ████ (Apart from the Runaway Bride with █████████ ████).<br /><br />Freema better be good!!!<br /><br />But nobody can beat ████!!!
