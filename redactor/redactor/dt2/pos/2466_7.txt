The connection with █████ ████?In a short plan ,we see ██████ ███████ toying with a teddy bear(remember the first scene of ███'s "rebel without a cause").Moreover,the main conflict is ███████ versus Sheen,father against son,as in "East of Eden".The soldier has come home,and nobody has been able to communicate with him, even his sister (a psychology student,what a derision).The mother,a crude matron (a superb █████ █████),gets bogged down in nougatine ,she 's not able to understand that her values (religion,family) have become a thing of the past,specially for someone like his son whose innocence was betrayed. The father ,an irresolute man ,under his wife's thumb,although he tries hard to play the macho,wanted to make up for the mediocrity of his life .So he saved his "honor" by forcing his son to do his duty.The scene in which ███████'s hatred for his father explodes is very intense.The actor-director gives a restrained performance,interiorized,as ███ █████████'s students used to do,and his final burst of anger is increased tenfold so.
