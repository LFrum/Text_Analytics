After seeing this movie, I came to the realization that ████ █████████ is a great actress. This movie wouldn't have been watchable without ████. The fact that somebody as attractive as ████, could actually gross me out, and she did when she was "█████ ███████". Her attempts to "transition" as the cool girls called it were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the night club.<br /><br />We also had SNL favorite, █████ ███████, playing a great part as █████, █████'s best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the movie was █████ trying to teach the class sex ed. This was one of Mollys funniest performances and best.<br /><br />██████ ████████ also had a great part and I really felt for her, because I know people like her that got tortured like that.<br /><br />This movie is a must see for ████ █████████ fans, because ████ makes the movie.
