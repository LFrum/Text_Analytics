When I was younger, and today, ███ ████ is a work of genius. Three-time BAFTA nominated █████ ████████ stars as the almost silent (miming) human looking alien dropped onto █████ causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. He has tried to do an exam, put his pants on in front of blind man (he didn't know he was blind), gone to church, tried to dive at a swimming pool, made lunch on a park bench, seen a scary movie, changed in his car, had a picnic with a fly intruding, spent █████████ with his girlfriend (███████ ███████), looked after a baby in Portsmouth, been to Room 426 of The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet contest with his Teddy, driven on top of his Mini on a new chair, and even met and knocked out the Queen. Guests included ███████ ██████, ███████ ██████, █████ ███████, ████ ███████ from They Think It's All Over, ████████ ███████, The Day Today's █████ █████████, ███████ ██████, The Fast Show's ████ ███████ and The Vicar of Dibley's █████ Lloyd-Pack. It was nominated the BAFTAs for ████ ██████ (Programme or Series) and ████ █████ █████████████ █████████. █████ ████████ was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 on The Comedians' Comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian. Outstanding!
