I have seen 'The ███ ██████' today and I loved it. The actors of the movie are wonderful (specially ██████ ██████, of course), but I thought that █████ █████ would have a better role. ████ Dueñas, █████ ██████ and, specially, █████ ██████ perform excellent interpretations. And I cannot forget █████ ███████ and ████ ██████ (brother and father of the protagonist).<br /><br />There are two technical aspects I loved very much: █████████████'s photography and the score by Amenábar himself. I liked the song, 'Negra sombra' ('Dark ██████'), by ███ █████ with music of ██████ Núñez.<br /><br />In short, I think that the Spanish Academy should choose 'The ███ ██████' in order to compete in the Oscar Awards. I liked other Spanish productions, such as █████████'s 'Bad Education', but Amenábar's film is much better than them. 'The ███ ██████' deserves all the awards.
