All credit to writer/director ██████ ███████ who fashioned this winding, twisting tale of deceit and betrayal. While keeping the utmost control, he maintains the audience at arm's length, never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on. Even his clever denouement has you guessing.<br /><br />The three central performances are also top class, with ███████ ██████, ██████ █████████ and ██████ ████████ doing their utmost to add to the mystery. ██████████████ ███████ supplements strength in his supporting role. To give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair.<br /><br />███████ ████████ uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma, and ███████ ███████████'s editing keeps the story a step ahead of us. The theme from █████ █████ is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script.<br /><br />Many may say ██████ ███████ is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love. For me this is simply a haunting, elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such tantalisation. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending.<br /><br />Monday, March 2, 1998 - █████ ███████<br /><br />No-one does thriller quite like the French. When they get it right, they really get it right.<br /><br />███████ ██████l is intriguing as the deceptive Max, ██████ █████████ obsessive as the new Lisa, and ██████ ████████ is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot from ██████ ███████ is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires.<br /><br />All credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot, and the performances from the three leads. As ██████, ██████████████ ███████ is strong and emotional.<br /><br />Friday, January 15, 1999 - █████
