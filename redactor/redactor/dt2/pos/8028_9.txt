This movie is about ██████ "The Jackal" (█████), an international terrorist who, by CIA agent █████ ██████'s (Sutherland) description, appears to maim women and children for the heck of it. At least that's what he says to guilt US Naval Officer ███████ ███████ (█████ again) into taking on the assignment of posing as ██████ and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. ███████ is apparently physically identical to ██████ but mentally he is his antithesis. He is borne of order and ██████ is borne of chaos.<br /><br />The movie isn't all shoot-gun-jump-around action, and that's a good thing. In its first half, ███████ undergoes training to act and think like ██████, and that's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run-of-the-mill action flicks. An Israeli agent (████████), joins Fields in training ███████, and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the birthing of ███████'s new character. ███████ is taught to dislike the things ██████ dislikes, to act on the split second like ██████ would, and even to make love like ██████ (courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of ██████'s). Naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie. It's a little contrived but █████ gives a riveting performance as a ██████-wannabe.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about this movie was that it didn't utilize the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies - you know, the one in which the evil twin insinuates himself into the good twin's family. ███████'s family does come into the picture, but instead they highlight how his new character wrecks havoc on his family life.<br /><br />Good chuckle humor is injected into this movie, often coming the acerbic duo of Sutherland and ████████. An exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke involving ███████'s first name (███████, █████████, get it?). Also overdone was the constant harping by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent ██████ is. In my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff wasn't able to match the build-up.<br /><br />On the whole, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it maintained my attention throughout.<br /><br />My rating: 9/10
