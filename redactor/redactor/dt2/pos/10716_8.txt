The Academy Award winning '██████ vs. ██████' follows a snazzy businessman ███ ██████ (██████ ███████) and his divorce with his bored wife (█████ ██████). One day ███'s wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life, forcing ███ to become closer to his son (██████ █████). The two bond and become very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is going perfect ███'s wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son. ███ then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him, and fights his wife in court. ██████ ███████ gives a tremendous performance along with █████ ██████, and young ██████ █████ is impressive. It's a sad emotional roller-coaster of a movie, but it's a very well-made and inspiring film. The film took the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1979 ███████ ██████, along with ████ █████ for ███████ and ████ ██████████ ███████ for ██████. If you don't mind a tearjerker, '██████ vs. ██████' is a great film to watch. Grade: B+
