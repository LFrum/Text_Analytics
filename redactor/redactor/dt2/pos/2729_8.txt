15 PARK AVENUE is the address "█████/Mithali" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. "Prof.███" (████████ ████)is █████'s extremely caring and loving half sister from █████'s mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (█████). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of █████, through her continuous blabbering to ███ and others. <br /><br />Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of █████ in this movie. You can see the look of a patient written on her face, by the drooping lips and sleepy eyes, from the first scene itself. █████ Bose has done a good job, but has been reduced to one half of the movie in spite of his importance in their life.<br /><br />Watch out for the intense relationships shown between the characters of the movie, █████ & ███, ███ & ███'s Mom and between ███ & Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). ████████ ████, as usual has done a riveting performance to be remembered as the sister, who sacrificed her life for █████.<br /><br />The movie might not be your usual Hindi potboiler, but can certainly make people look at the schizophrenic patients in a different light altogether.<br /><br />As usual, ██████ ███ brings the movie to a different ending rather than any clichéd ones, we might think off. Hats off to her, for this great movie!!!
