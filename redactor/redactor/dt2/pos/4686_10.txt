The greatest compliments to the other commentator here at IMDb who asked himself why this series didn't "get stuck" in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the 80s did.<br /><br />It is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued.<br /><br />I will at the end of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie realizations, rather: attempts of the █████ ████ legend.<br /><br />First of All, ██████ █████ (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever.<br /><br />Nothing is as fun as the entire two, if one wants, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time absolutely agreeing with the mostly new and revolutionary findings of █████ █████' history documentations about Egypt, Greece, Rome, ██████████████, the Goths and Barbarians, and the middle ages and crusades (...yes, THE Monthy Python-█████ █████):<br /><br />If you have seen those brilliant and funny Jones-Docs you will better, much better understand all the historical background stuff █████████, the writer of the █████ of Sherwood-series (which happens to be the brother of ████ █████████, who made "The Thing", their third brother makes music), intended to tell us.<br /><br />The writer of "████ ██████", "Catweazle" and the first two seasons of "█████ of Sherwood", called "Kip" █████████, is my movie overlord. He's better than all those others who criticize his "sword-and-sorcery" element or "defectiveness" (taken from the █████ of Sherwood Webring) of this series (that I can not see) or have other non-fundamented criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now.<br /><br />That's why, when you get to know this "█████ of Sherwood" better, you'll be severe. You will at first loathe the third season. Not only that: I did myself go thru this, and on top of it, I have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that █████, the actor of █████, left this series, because after the series had enormous success, he was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called "The new Adeventures of █████ █████" - already the title reveals the emptiness of the whole project. █████ went for money, and not for fame, he didn't stick with his gang and kin, I mean: as actors.<br /><br />Actors who personally represent the afterwards "really", in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the █████-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have been let blossomed a lot more without any degrading niveau of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues.<br /><br />Again, obligatory to say: A change of the main role was forced by █████'s stupid decision of leaving █████ of Sherwood for a silly remake-series of the Verne-tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story. Still it is in some aspects a catastrophe.<br /><br />Anyway: If one is informed about this, and that ███████ was maybe really advertised by his father, but that the young ███████ DID NOT AT ALL "chase █████ away", how I prejudicially thought in the first place, then one can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season. ███ here is that the script was not anymore written by ████████ ███ █████████, so we don't have anymore that critical and free-thinking historical background like i.e. in "The Witch of Elsdon", or in "The King's Fool", two episodes of the first series that is A) funny, B) historically educating and C) brilliantly acted. ===<br /><br />"Don't trust the Lion!"<br /><br />Unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own gain of power, ███████ █████████, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than ████ or others, but used it only for his wicked idea of the crusade and the war against Normandie in France. He slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than tens of thousands of Christians, ███████ and Jews in the "wholy" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children they slayed out of hunger or poverty. On top of that, after his capture by the Saracens (muslims) in the crusades, Britain was squeezed out for his ransom, 100.000 marks (at that time, 11th century, comparable to approx. 30 Billion - 30'000'000'000.- Dollars of current value), to get him safely back, and then he just visited England for a month to return to Normandie (in France, where the Norman Invaders went first) for the crusades (one learns that in the episode "The King's Fool"). For this new crusade, possibly kind of a revenge for his capture, ███████ █████████ again "drains the country of money" (cited out of █████ ██████'s mouth, when he lectures █████ in being critical with even the King). █████ criticizes this warfare unsocial ruling of ███████'s, he addresses ███████ himself, telling him "The poor gave everything to set you free, how CAN you ask more of them?" - ███████: "...Give me your courage and strength, not your words!" ...Later, in private, ███████ orders the assassination of █████...<br /><br />So, the crusaders were the real "barbarians".<br /><br />P.S: Already when I watched ███████ in 91, I got upset, because after-wards, I found out in history course in school that ███████ was not that good just man as displayed by ████ ███████ in his appearance at the end of "Prince of the Thieves". Well, as █████ █████ would put it: It is a lie, a treacherous lie!" Sean plays humorist and charismatic, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of "█████ of Sherwood".<br /><br />Again: █████ is, according to my info up to now, the one who left Sherwood for a stupid Verne-series nobody with brains will EVER remember or want to remember.
