I´m from germany so please excuse my style of writing. As I´ve seen ██████ 4 for the first time I was a bit surprised, I knew ██████ as a usual 80s scarymovie, but Bride of ██████ was very different from the old ones. First there is the artwork of the very good director █████ ██, who we still have in mind from A chinese ghost story. His visual style is in a wired kinda way comparable to ███████ ████ ███████. Also the voices of ██████ an Tiff are very impressive. I´ve also liked the screenplay very much, especially the scene in which Tiff throws the Champaignbottle in the ceilingmirror.<br /><br />I give it a 9.0 vote for funny, gory and progressive entertainment. If you have any comments on my opinion, just send me an E-Mail. MFG Schawez
