██████ put, ████ ███████ and ████████ ████████ were remarkable. The movie is less about the raw science of ██████'s beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, ████, and daughter, █████ █<br /><br />Toby █████ gives a wonderful turn as ██████ ██████, the great defender of ██████'s beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with ███████ and ████████.<br /><br />But it is those two who carry the movie. Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as ██████ grapples with his demons. The scene where ██████ relates the ending of the story of Jenny, the orangutan, to his dying daughter, █████, is utterly gripping. The world premiere audience at the TIFF was spellbound. ███████'s performance will be recognized as one of the year's best in short order. Equally magnificent is ████████'s work playing the religious wife of a man who, in Huxley's words, "killed God".<br /><br />The film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of ██████'s grief, relishing every detail of ███████ and ████████'s acting.<br /><br />Brilliant.
