It's really good to see ███ █████'s film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops "Derailed" and "Second in command" which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: ██████ patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. It's good to know that ███ █████ still knows how to kick seeing as his last film "Until Death" had no martial arts in it at all!!!<br /><br />That being said, this film is significantly inferior to "Until Death" which was a really good turn for ███ █████. "Until Death" lacked the over-the-top action of most ███ █████ films but was dark and gritty and ███ █████'s performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. Still, The Shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for ███ █████ fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line.....you may want to skip this one!<br /><br />I do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on. The only real problem I have with this film is the title; "The Shepherd"? I don't get it! I suppose "██████ ██████" just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word "Shepherd" in front of it!!!<br /><br />My rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by ███ █████ movie standards not in any other film category.<br /><br />i.e. It's good for a ███ █████ film.
