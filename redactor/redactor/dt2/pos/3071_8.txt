I first saw █████ ████: Men in Tights back in 1994 in the cinema. I went to see it because I always liked █████ ████ and I saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was hilarious. After I saw the movie I must say it was even better than I thought. Not only is it very funny, it's also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by ██████ ████. The acting in the movie is also good, ████ █████ is funny as █████ ████ and also ██████ ██████, ███████ █████, ████ ██████████, █████ ████████, ███ ███████, █████ ████████, ████ █████ ██████, ███████ ████████ and ███ ██████ himself are funny. But the best part in the movie is played by █████ ████ as the evil Sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue ("King illegal forest to pig wild kill in it a is", which stands for "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest").He somehow mixes up all the words and speaks out a sentence that nobody understands. █████ ████: Men in Tights is in my book one of the best ███ ██████ films to date and I can't say that I have laughed as much about a film as this one. It's just non-stop laughing.
