I remember really liking BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think that this is the best of all the ██████ movies (even over ███████████ █████'s terrific 2005 BATMAN BEGINS and definitely over the seriously over-hyped overrated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). I originally remember thinking that the 1st BATMAN w/ ████ █████████ was the best (and I still love it). But I think that this movie really hits the nail on the head. The 4 main characters (██████, ███████, ████████, and ███ ██████) are all vivid and memorable. You really get to see what ██████/Bruce Wayne is all about in ██████'s terrific characterization. ██████ is the best ██████, not Kilmer, ███████, or even the up-and-coming Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could have stolen top honors from ██████ had his character not been destroyed by █████'s hack film-making in TDK !. <br /><br />█████ ██████ as The ███████ is disturbing, scary, hilarious, and lethal. DeVito is great and doesn't need scenery-chewing to give great performance like █████████'s Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society. I had never really been big fan of ████████ ████████ until this film, but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers. Pfeiffer's ██████ ████ is goofy and odd at first, then when she is transformed into ████████, she is simultaneously sexy and scary, a total deadly sexpot! Also, I feel that ██████ and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than ██████ and Basinger from BATMAN; they form a tragic love story. And ███████████ ██████ as ██████ is, well, as always, ███████████ ██████!<br /><br />BATMAN RETURNS, more so than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. It is assured film-making from beginning to end. The way ██████ introduces the ███████'s heartbreaking backstory grabs you from the very beginning. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings to any film: █████ ██████'s music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film. It is a modification from the original BATMAN and a great one!<br /><br />Then flash forward 33 years to the present day ██████ and we are introduced to powerful businessman ██████ who wants to build new power plant in ██████. During same scene we meet ██████'s meek, bullied, under-confident secretary ██████ ████. And not long after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as ██████ must battle The ███████'s Red Triangle Gang, a fun yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers. ███████ sets plan in motion to attack the ██████ Christmas celebration, kidnap ██████ in the chaos, and force him to help re-introduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers ██████'s criminal plans and so he "kills" her by shoving her out his high-rise office, then she is revived by cats. <br /><br />█████ convoluted? Yes, but ██████ never claimed to be posing a realistic story. He has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark, noirish world comprised of mistreated, deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in. Confident storytelling if you ask me!<br /><br />The action scenes are few and far in between, but they are all exciting, entertaining, and nail-biting. They aren't there just for show, the way some in BATMAN are. And they all make sense. The climactic scene with ███████'s "army" marching into the center of ██████ with ██████ zoning in on ███████'s hideout and sidekick butler Alfred (███████ █████ in a welcome return from the original!) assisting ██████ is succinct, solid, heart-pounding fun!<br /><br />I also love the Christmastime, wintry setting, which adds to the super-dark, cold feel of ██████'s ██████ world. I also love the way ██████ slowly introduces to us the ██████ "toys" without shoving them down our throats. Each "toy" is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose. And although dark, RETURNS is still a funny film. DeVito's ███████ has many funny lines. So does ██████'s ██████. The ██████-████████ exchanges are extremely stimulating and humor-filled as well! A great ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in ███ ██████'s fun, comic book world.
