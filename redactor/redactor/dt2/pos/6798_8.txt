██████ ██████ (as ██ ██████) is a young man drifting along the figurative road to ruin, where he meets 12-year-old █████████ ██████ (as ██████ █████) - she adores horses, but he has a sad history with the animals. Ms. ██████ is enamored with ███ ██████'s horse-sense; she takes him home, and gets him room and board with her family. They are supported very well by ████ ██████ and ██████ █████ (as ██ █ and Mrs. Brown). █████ Jenkins and ██████ ████████ are ██████'s strained siblings.<br /><br />The plot of "National Velvet" is implausible to a fault; for example, the circumstances leading to ██████'s ride in the "Big Race" are quite a stretch (but were likely more believable on paper). Still, the characters' connection to horses, and to Ms. Revere's character are nicely conceived. ██████ and ██████ are excellent in the starring roles; there is a balance between ██████'s fading "child star" and ██████'s exuberant new "child star", which adds depth to their characterizations.<br /><br />The excellent performances of ██████ and ██████ are further enhanced by fine direction, photography, and editing from ████████ █████, ███████ █████, and ██████ ████. A sentimental classic. <br /><br />******** National Velvet (12/14/44) ████████ █████ ~ ██████ ██████, █████████ ██████, ████ ██████
