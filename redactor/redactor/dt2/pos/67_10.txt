This █████ ███████ film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. No matter, the sheer presence of █████ ███████, is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. █████ is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film. ████ ██████ looks tired, but he's is more than fine, as █████'s romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes, add to the appeal. Overall, the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited (by █████ ███████) version of the original release. Supposedly, this is the only version that ███████ would allow; but, ██████ ███████ ██████ has shown the complete (theatrical release) version, recently. Recommended.
