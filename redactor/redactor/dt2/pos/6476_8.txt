"█████ ██████ ███ ████████", the biopic about the famous █████ ████ beloved coach █████ ██████, is an excellent sports film to watch. Not ever having seen it, we were surprised by the technique used in the movie by director █████ █████, who shows he was ahead of his times in photographing football games. The result is a vibrant picture about the man responsible for the legacy of the collegian sport, █████ ██████.<br /><br />The film presents ██████ from his humble origins in Chicago to his studies in famed █████ ████ ██████████ in South Bend, Indiana. He was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played. Luckily, he went to give his beloved █████ ████ the glory he was after.<br /><br />███ ███████ looks a bit older when he starts as a freshman. In fact, he doesn't change much throughout the film, but he is fine as ███ ██████. ███ ███████ shows he could inspire the players under him by just being a father figure. ████ Page plays ██████ ██████, the wise woman who understood her husband's call in life. ██████ Reagan plays ██████ "The ████er" ████, who was a legend that died much too young, but who left a legacy behind. ██████ Crisp makes a good contribution as ██████ ████ ████████ who was ██████'s mentor at the university.<br /><br />This film will delight not only sports because of LLoyd Bacon's direction and the fast pace he gives to the movie.
