Red ███████ (in his first starring role) plays █████ ██████ who plays 'The ███' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The ███' solves them. ██████ █████ (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps ██████, his girlfriend (███ ██████████) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey). He tells ██████ to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...<br /><br />Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across. ███████ is very good in his first starring role--very funny, fast, handsome and intelligent. Veidt is excellent as the evil █████. Rutherford and Grey are lots of fun as ███████'s girlfriends. All three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic. Also fun to see ███ █████ in a small role.<br /><br />Well worth your time.
