This wonderfully witty comedy-drama wowed the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival, whipping them into wild applause at its conclusion. Buttressed by adept performances by a nuanced cast, sturdy execution by director ████ ████, a brisk pace, and one of █████ ████'s best performances in years, the film emerges as a loving homage to the highs and woes of family life.<br /><br />Falk excels as Jewish ninetysomething ██████ █████████, a wildly eccentric Shakespearean thespian who decides to end his life, but not before rounding up his three grown children and throwing a "big fat Jewish suicide party." The film brims with indelible delights. There's ██████'s "tushy room"; █████ ███ ███████'s passionate rendering of ██████'s cynical daughter; rapid-fire comedic dialogue that recalls the work of ████ █████ and █████ █████; the wry timing of █████ ██████, who plays ██████'s tightly wound psychotherapist son; and ██████'s patented egg creams (but be careful, drinking them too fast will cause a nasty brain freeze). It's all enveloped in a feel-good, intimate atmosphere set in New York City.<br /><br />Director ████ ████ proves to be a master craftsman, drawing out memorable performances from his cast and lending the film a mirthful humanity. I was fortunate to see an earlier film by ████: the dark and powerful "███████ ██████ ███," starring ████ █████████ ("Minority Report") as a Los Angeles man spiraling into madness. The visceral grit of "Perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "Checking Out" are a testament to ████'s eclecticism and wide-ranging talent. I'm looking forward to checking out his future work.<br /><br />I heard "Checking Out" lacks a distributor at this point. Some wise company would do well to pick up this crowd-pleasing gem, for it's a potential box-office titan in the vein of "My Big ███ █████ ███████." Most nobly, it would give people around the world a chance to experience the joys of this movie.
