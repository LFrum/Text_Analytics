In Russia, the ordinary teenager ████ (███████ ██████) lives a leisured life with her drunkard father and her simpleton mother, without working and waiting for the calling for a technical course of telephone operator. Her brother ██████ (█████████ ███████) lives in Moscow with the family of his own and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and ████, being always motive for arguing. When ████ meets the student of university Sergei (██████ ███████), they fall in love for each other and decide to get married. Sergei moves to ████'s house, but lives in conflict with her father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy.<br /><br />I have just seen "█████████ ████", and I liked a lot this deep family drama. I am not familiarized with the life style in the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first one, when ██████ tells ████ that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a larger apartment. Another one, when the family goes to the beach in a truck. Many difficulties of ████'s family and their friends, the repression in the park and other situations pictured in the movie are common in Third World countries. This low budget movie is very well-directed, and the story is very profound and real. The cast has great performances and the actress ███████ ██████ is very beautiful. In the cover of the Brazilian VHS, released by ██████ distributor, there is information that ███████ ██████ was the centerfold of Playboy magazine. I am not sure how precise are the subtitles in Portuguese, since many long sentences spoken in Russian are limited to short translation in few words. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Pequena ████" ("The Little ████")
