Co-scripted by ███████ ██ ████ from, arguably, ██████ ██ ████████'s best and hardest to find novel, "A Travesty". *Very* faithful to the story, the movie stars ████ as a hapless man who gets in way too far over his head after attempting to cover up an accidental death. ███████ ████ █████ and █████ ████████ in good supporting roles. The strength of the movie is in the intricate twist-after-twist storyline and in the acting, particularly by ████ who routinely and delightfully breaks through the 4th wall here and gets away with it every time. A good storyline with much dark humor, this one engaged me enough that I've watched it three times in the week since it came out. Prepare to shelve your critical faculties and emit a loud, bipartisan "wheeeeee!".
