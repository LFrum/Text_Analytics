I liked this movie. Many people refer to it as "Sabrina the Teenage Feminist". They do that with a lot of movies that ███████ ████ ████ is in. Still, she really surprised me in this movie because she was great in the part of ████, who fights for justice when her roommate is raped. You could tell that ████ was extremely determined in this movie and it showed. I also liked ████ ████ ████ as ████'s roommate. She was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped. ████ ███████ was good as the cocky and egotistical rapist. ███████ █████ convincingly played his character. The acting in this movie is better than in most TV movies, in my opinion.<br /><br />The movie was pretty predictable though. Also, I expected more from the ending, it was too abrupt. The delivery could have been better. But the performances and overall plot make up for these problems.
