One of our all time family favorites. When we need a laugh...we just put this one in and laugh all way thru like it is the first time we've seen it. This film has good, clean family humor. █████ Shore is brilliant! With no plans for the thanksgiving holiday, █████ (Shore) is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative coed, █████. █████, being a big city boy, must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with █████. But, █████ isn't the only one who is learning new things. █████ teaches █████ and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others. This is fun for viewers of all ages.
