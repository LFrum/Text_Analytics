I never heard of architect, █████ ████, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, █████████ ████, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, ███████, and ██ █████, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, █████ ████ had three families including his wife, ██████, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter ███ ███. █████████ includes his family members. █████ also has another half-sister █████████ █████ from his father's previous relationship with ████ ████, a fellow architect. █████' passion was his art.
