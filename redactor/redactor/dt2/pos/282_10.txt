Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years, with ████ █████' 'Austin Powers' and █████ ████████'s 'Johnny ███████', and more recently █████ ██████ in the big-screen version of the hit '60's show 'Get █████!'.<br /><br />Back in 1974, it was █████ █████ who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attaché case full of documents marked 'Classified'.<br /><br />'The Top Secret Life Of █████ ██████' was his first starring role in a sitcom, after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as 'Six Dates With ██████', the 'Doctor' series, and 'Hark At ██████'.<br /><br />Humphrey ███████ had found him working in a pier theatre in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside ███████ █████, █████ █████ and ████ ████ in the children's comedy show 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!'.<br /><br />'T.T.S.L.O.E.B' cast █████ as '█████ ██████', a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service. ███████ ████ █████ wore a bowler hat, ██████ had a trilby. ███████ ████████ ████ carried a radio pen, ██████ owned a pipe. ███████ fell to bits in his hands. He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife ( ███████ ██████ ) perused █████'s Own ( on one occasion it would be the other way round ). When he tracked a pair of Russian agents to a heliport, he accidentally switched on the airport's Tannoy system, and broadcast his plans to capture them! When he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an S.I.S. man and his enemy-contact, it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to Brighton! When he tried to organise the defection of a female Russian scientist, he took a 'short cut' to elude his pursuers, only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park. Yet, like 'Inspector Clouseau', he always seemed to come out on top at the end, much to the dismay of his colleagues.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, he was married. His wife ████████ was understanding about the sort of work he did. Though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high-rise flat: "Secret Service this, Secret Service that! You never stop thinking about the Secret Service!". He shouted back: "Think of the neighbours! They're not supposed to know I'm in the Secret Service!".<br /><br />██████ was part of a team of agents whose number included 'Coronation ██████' villain ████ ████ ( he was the psychotic ████ ███████ ) as 'Spencer', ███████ ████████ as ███████', and 'Doctor At Sea''s █████████ ████████ as the lovely 'Cathy ██████'. They answered to 'The Commander', played by the late ████ ███████. The Commander was kidnapped in one episode, leaving ██████ temporarily in charge of the S.I.S. - which naturally horrified everyone.<br /><br />This hilarious show was by ███████ █████ and ███████ ███████, who had written for the 'Doctor' series. Rather than spoof ████, it was more of a send-up of the serious spy shows such as 'Callan' ( though it had a ████-style theme tune ). Furtive meetings in underground car parks, code-breaking, stolen missile plans, that kind of thing. █████ brought a lot of energy to the role, doing a lot of his own stunts, such as ██████ falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat, and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin, and were reminiscent of those to be found in the 'Pink ███████' films.<br /><br />'██████' had all the ingredients to be a smash-hit. Unfortunately, it was not networked. In the London area, it was put out on Sundays at 7.25 P.M. where it was trounced in the ratings by the B.B.C.'s soapy drama 'The Brothers'. It was then moved to Fridays at 7 P.M. because I.T.V. wanted to showcase its latest American import - the T.V. version of 'Planet Of The Apes'. ██████ never found an audience. A similar fate befell █████'s next major show: 1976's 'Lucky ██████'. It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake Of ██████' that he found his first successful solo vehicle.<br /><br />You can see the title sequence ( along with two brief excerpts in German! ) for this series on YouTube. Unfortunately, that is all you can see. █████ will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on D.V.D. A great shame. For the moment, however, █████ ██████' life will have to remain top secret.<br /><br />CODA: I have seen a number of episodes recently and I'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well.
