I think that ███████ ██████ is the best actor in the cast. She makes Sam one of the best character on the show. █████ Cann is also pretty good. I love it when he worried about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes in when ██ and Delinda are beating the crap out of some guy. That was funny. █████ Cox is also good and she has great chemistry with ████ ███████. ████ █████ █████ was awesome in her guest role. I wish they hadn't killed her off. The show has a great cast with no bad actors which isn't something you often see on TV. I still think ███████ ██████ is the best though. She should have got an Emmy in my opinion. It's a shame the show was cancelled
