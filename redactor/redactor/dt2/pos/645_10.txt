I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for ███████ █████████. The primary actors (Campbell Scott, ████████ █████, █████ ██████, █████ ███████ ███, ███████ ███████, and ██████ █████) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence. It was a very uplifting movie that I wish was available on tape or DVD. A rare gem.
