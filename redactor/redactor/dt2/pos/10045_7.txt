Whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac, debates about the life and military career of ██████ █████████ ██████ continue down to the present day. They Died With █████ █████ On presents certain facts of the ██████ story and has taken liberty with others.<br /><br />He did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at West Point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to █████████ ███████. His record leading the Michigan Regiment under his command was one of brilliance.<br /><br />It was also true that his marriage to █████ █████ was one of the great love matches of the 19th century. █████ and ██████ were married for 12 years until The Little Big Horn. What's not known to today's audience is that █████ survived until 1933. During that time she was the custodian of the ██████ legend. By dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way.<br /><br />I think █████ █████ and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity to have the ██████ career told in flashback. ██████ ███████████ should have been made up the way ████████ █████████ was in Maytime, and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance. Even then the cracks in the ██████ legend were appearing, but if done from █████'s point of view, they could be understood and forgiven.<br /><br />Sydney Greenstreet gave a fine performance as General Winfield █████. The only problem was that █████ had nothing whatsoever to do with ██████, he was retired and replaced by ██████ ██ █████████ in late 1861 while ██████ was still at West Point. I'm not sure they ever met. But Greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful Winfield █████. A nice Mexican War story should have been what they gave Greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old Fuss and Feathers.<br /><br />The film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema, █████ █████ and ██████ ███████████. This was the last of eight films they did together. The last scene they ever did for the cameras was █████'s farewell to ██████ as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign. Both their performances, Olivia's especially, was a high point in their careers at Warner Brothers. We know through history that ██████ is riding to his doom, that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy. If your eyes don't moisten you are made of marble. <br /><br />As history They Died With █████ █████ On leaves a lot to be desired. As western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action, you can't beat this film at all.
