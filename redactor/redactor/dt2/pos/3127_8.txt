A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for ████ in that it lacks any big stars. ███████ gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and █████ work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by ████ favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western "█████ █████" before his untimely death at age 57. Featuring beautiful cinematography, ████ regarded this as one of his favorite films.
