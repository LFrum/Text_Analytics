I Love ██████ ████ to Jail. It's one of my top 3 favorite ██████ movies. The others being ██████ ██████ ██████ and ██████ ████ to Camp. In this movie ██████ (███ ██████) works as a janitor for a bank but he wants to be a bank clerk. Soon he is assigned jury duty but soon winds up in trouble when the evil murderer █████ ████ (██████ also) knocks him out and switches places with him! Soon ██████ is in jail and is forced to act like ████ or else ████ will kill █████████ ██████'s love interest. When they take ██████ to the electric chair thinking he's ████ he gets so electrocuted he winds up breaking out and goes off and saves Charlotte from the evil ████! Filled with hilarious scenes and comics ██████ ████ to Jail is a movie that'll make you laugh so hard! It still does to me! ███ ██████ was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both good guy and bad guy! ██████ was like his Toy Story Co star ███ █████. No matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and that's one of the things that ██████'s gonna be remembered forever for! R.I.P. ███ ██████ 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing ██████ and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!
