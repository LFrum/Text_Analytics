Unlike most people who've commented, I was born after the last Sylvester █████ ███████ and so couldn't have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first. I thoroughly enjoyed it when ███████████ █████████ took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series. I have, since then, seen old episodes of ██████ ███ and some where great, but, like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate to continue. The 21st century doctor who's are great, I thought ██████ was great, almost a match for the doctor and if ████'s appearance is anything to go by, she's going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5.<br /><br />Speaking of ████, the spin of, █████████ is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes (though this is definitely more suitable for kids). However, if you insist that this isn't the same and just isn't ██████ ███, please, just stay in your basement.<br /><br />10/10
