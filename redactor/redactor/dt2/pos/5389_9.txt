If you like ████ ██████, this is one of his best roles. His gentle intensity to right a wrong is what made his career. "██████ █████████" comes to Dallas to take revenge against ████ and █████ ██████, who burned his Georgia farm and killed his family. █████ Marshall gets in █████████'s way, attempting to arrest him when interrupted by a street shootout between █████████ and ████ ████ ███████. The shootout is staged to get the law off █████████, & he takes the "back East" Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas, as they switch identity. <br /><br />That was a great beginning, and the picture holds up all the way through. Action may be a little "slow" by today's standards, but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
