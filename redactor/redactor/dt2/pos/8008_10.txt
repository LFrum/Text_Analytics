Out of all the Bat-films, ██████ ███████ is my favorite. This beautiful, dark, and funny film is one of ███ ██████'s best work. Although it is much violent and darker, this is the ██████ that creator ███ ████ envisioned many years ago. ███████ ██████ reprises his role as the avenger of ██████ ████. This time he's up against two deadly foes, █████ ██████'s Penguin and ████████ ████████'s Catwoman. With a great cast and film score by █████ ██████, the movie takes us on an adventure as ██████ battles the evil forces that are trying to take over ██████ ████. ███████████ ██████ makes a great appearance as ███ █████, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve. But of course, ████████ ████████ is the one that steals the show. With all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies. It's got everything. It's really a shame that ███ ██████ didn't get to direct the other sequels. If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today. ██████ ███████ is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.
