Although I'm not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of ████ ████████ and ████ █████. The film may be dated by today's standards and the story and songs may be nothing special, but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and there's a terrific cast to go with the film. Plus, the film is a worthy introduction for fans of ████ ████████...she's simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolor.<br /><br />Despite ██████ ████'s collaboration with the film, his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), yet the songs serve the film well. The dancing is nothing short of excellent, especially coming from ████ █████'s solo number and my favorite musical number, "Alter-Ego Dance." The amusing ████ ███████ nearly steals the film as █████'s partner. ████ Kruger, ███ █████, and ██████ ██████ give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles. And ████ plays a sweet, charming girl here; a role that's a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941).<br /><br />All in all, this is a delightful film that's worth watching even if you're not big on musicals. Yet the film's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters, ██████ ██████ or ████ ██████, wrote the songs for this film. However, it's the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the film's production.<br /><br />While I was watching ████ ████████ do her stuff, I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw █████ ███████ in ███████ ██████'s masterpiece, THE RED SHOES (1948). Just watch ████ in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
