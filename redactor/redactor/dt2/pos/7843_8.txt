Another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti-hero makes it hard to decide who to root for.<br /><br />If nothing else "The Beguiled" silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies-at least in 1971. There were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed.<br /><br />Pamelyn ██████ did a fine job as ███ and would go on to play "█████ June". This must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on camera, wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time. It was probably ████████'s favorite scene. Given the fate of ███'s turtle "Randolph", it is no surprise that ██████ grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist.<br /><br />█████████ ████ was likewise excellent, playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint. It is interesting that she died just three days after █████████ ███████ committed suicide (throwing herself through a fifth floor window) as they had also worked together in "You're a Big Boy Now".<br /><br />Hartman (who looks like she could be █████ █████'s sister) was wonderful as Edwina and should have gotten an Oscar (no other performance was even close that year), but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her. Edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch. Like ███████ ██████'s incredible performance in "The Misfits", the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing.<br /><br />Finally there is ██ ███ ██████ who is stunningly perfect as the flirty █████. For my money ██████ was the sexiest actress of the 1970's, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the "Most Wanted" television series and the only reason to watch "████ ████ ████ Revisited". ████ to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star.
