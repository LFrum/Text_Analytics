████ was such a great show.It was simple but somehow very addicting.I can still remember the days when I'd watch this on ████ ██ █████████ ,but then ████ ██ did the unforgivable.████ ██ became like that older relative that tries to act "hip" and "funky fresh".*shudder*They became like that relative who tries to act all cool ,but the attempt is a cheesy disaster.They pulled ███████ ████'s █████ █████ ██████ and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows I've ever seen In my life(██████ ████).The only thing that keeps me watching KWB anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kids.It was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule.This brings me back to my first point... BRING IT BACK!!!
