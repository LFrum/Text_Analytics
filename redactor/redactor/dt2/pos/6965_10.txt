Sixth (And last) movie in the boxset. Well, looks like I've saved the best one for last. ████████ IV. I originally did a review for this back in like February, but I decided to do a new one. The ████████ series is pretty awesome. I know there are some people who don't like them, and that's fine. This happens to be my favorite one in the series. Yeah, I know the actual ████████ don't appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes, one of them being ████ ███ from ███ █████. Now, onto the movie.<br /><br />The movie centers around ████████ ██████, the main character from the first movie, being played once again, by █████ ██████, who is now a cop for the LAPD and has put his past of the occult behind him. During the first part of the movie, we encounter █████████ (Played by the very hot ██████ ███████) communicating with a demon from beyond named █████, who is the dark side of Jonathan. █████ asks █████████ for a red jewel and something goes awry, therefore, unleashing the ████████ from the beyond.<br /><br />I think ███ ████████ did a good job with the directing. And the music by █████ ██████ is funny as well. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this movie, the ████████ say that there will be a ████████ IV, Part 2, or ████████ V. I still hope that sequel gets made and I especially hope ███ ████████ returns to direct. I agree with GimboThe████████ on that.
