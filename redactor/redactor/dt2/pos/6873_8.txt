██████ ███████ is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner ████ ██████ from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films - a female partner. This was ██████ ███████, the English double Oscar winner, who demonstrated her comic abilities against ███████'s first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. ███████'s role was slightly larger in both films, because his characters were more central to the plots, but the chemistry between them was quite good. If you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch ██████ and ██████ as Dr. ███████ █████████ and ███ ████████ experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor! Never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view.<br /><br />███████'s ███████ has just been widowed before the film began. He has only had one woman in his life - his wife. So now he's the eligible bachelor. He also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of, but the chief surgeon is Dr. ████ Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off - see the scene where he rams ███████ ████████'s car). ████ is up for re-election (███████ is his closest competitor for the post - if he wants it). However, ████ manages to convince ███████ to let him keep the job for reasons of self-esteem.<br /><br />One day ███████ notices ███ in the hospital. She has had a slight accident and is resting in bed, but ████ has put her into a cage like apparatus (which ███████ remarks has not been used since about 1920). He gets her out of the device, and soon is romancing her. She joins the staff of the hospital, but she is critical of ███████'s willingness to cater to ████, and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital.<br /><br />████' bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital (█████ █████), who owned a baseball team (his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers). ████ tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner, delivering the eulogy at the burial service (the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy). However she is still determined to sue (her lawyer ██████ █████ says the hospital is the most incompetent he's ever seen). So ████ suggests that ███████ romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit. But how will ███ react to this? The film is quite amusing, and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for ███████ and ███████, it led to a television series as well.
