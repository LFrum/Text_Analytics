PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: ████ ███████, father figure & manager of the Chipmunk brothers █████, █████ & Theodore, has gone off to Europe on a business trip, leaving the boys at home with ████ ██████ as their watcher, much to the chagrin of █████, who wanted to go to Europe. While playing against his female counterpart, Brittany, the leader of the Chipettes, comprised of her younger sisters ████████ (the female counterpart of █████) and ███████ (the female counterpart of Theodore) in a fierce arcade game of Around the World in 30 Days, they catch the attention of two evil foreign siblings who need to smuggle money & diamonds around the world, but need a way to do it that won't draw the attention of their arch enemy, █████. The 2 evil siblings, ███████ & █████, overhear the banter between █████ & Brittany and decide to use them as the delivery boys & girls for their loot (more ███████'s idea than █████'s, the latter initially objects feeling that it's too dangerous for children). The 2 siblings make an offer to the boys & girls - travel via air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls (which resemble the kids) that contain diamonds and/or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the race will get an obscene amount of money. But as the two different set of talking animal siblings make their rounds, they are stalked by the henchmen of █████ - but who is █████? Is he friend or foe? <br /><br />OVERALL: Enjoyable, lighthearted farce based on the 1980s TV series version of █████ & the Chipmunks. Beautiful animation is a highlight, lacks the crude humor that keeps creeping into today's family films and engaging songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll being a stand out). █████ eyed fans will probably notice that Brittany's character design has been tweaked from the animated series, giving her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to cheeks (which ████████ & ███████ also display).<br /><br />Keep an ear out for █████ ██████████, the voice of ████ ███████.
