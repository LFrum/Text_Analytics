Although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life, and also nothing could be more real than █████ █████ playing ██████. This remains the best film made about ██████. The music of Max Steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the Irish song "█████ ████", which was a favourite of ██████ is played. The film should have more villains, because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between █████ and ██ █████████ flows like in no other off their films together, and director █████ █████ with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best.
