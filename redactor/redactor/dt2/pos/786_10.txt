A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.<br /><br />Poor ██████ becomes THE GOAT ("scapegoat") for a dangerous escaped murderer.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, hilarious little film with ██████ at his absolute best. In what is essentially a series of chases, ██████ gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. Big ███ ███████ appears as the highly suspicious police chief.<br /><br />Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats, ██████ ██████ (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age. An association with █████ ████████ led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic, silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928. Writer, director, star & stuntman - ██████ could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience. More akin to Fairbanks than ███████, ██████'s films were full of splendid adventure, exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable. His theme of a little man against the world, who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity, dominates his films. Through every calamity & disaster, ██████ remained the Great Stone Face, a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad.<br /><br />In the late 1920's ██████ was betrayed by his manager/brother-in-law and his contract was sold to MGM, which proceeded to nearly destroy his career. Teamed initially with █████ ███████ and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies, ██████ was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent. Finally, before lung cancer took him at age 70, he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered. Now, well past his centenary, ██████ ██████ is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses. And he knew how to make people laugh...
