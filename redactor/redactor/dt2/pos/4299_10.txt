█████ ███████'s maze-like novel 'A Way Through the Wood' has been adapted by ██████ ████████ who also directs this 'terribly British' drawing room suspense piece. It is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the varyingly benign/malignant characters and it is here that ████████' directorial choices are superb. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident ignites a minefield of disasters.<br /><br />█████ ███████ (███ █████████) is a successful business obsessed solicitor in London, married to ████ (█████ ██████) who needs more in her life: the couple being childless live in the country in a beautiful estate, assisted by their long term 'cleaner' ██████ (█████ ███████). They attend social outings and meet, among others, ███████ ████ (██████ ███████), the passively lazy wealthy neighbor. ████ decides they should entertain their neighbors and against gruff █████' protestation ████ proceeds with planning: █████ arranges to 'not attend due to business'. On the night of the party there is a hit and run accident in which ██████'s husband is accidentally killed by someone in a █████ █████ (she observed). When █████ returns home he sees a scratch on ███████'s █████ █████ and suspects ███████ to be the perpetrator. ████ discourages █████ from going to the police with the information -'what possible good can it do but ruin ████'s life as a socialite and father and son of an important scion?'. From this first 'lie' the virus spreads: █████ confronts ████ who talks █████ out of going to the police, ████ confesses it was she who was driving ████'s Rover and is the one responsible, █████ convinces ████ to keep it quiet because it would ruin his reputation, ████ confesses she is having an affair with ████, and the three of them concur that they will stick together on their big lie for the sake of the greater good. ████ eventually succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved ██████ that she is the one responsible and ██████, herself guilty of a previous theft whose life was saved by ████'s mercy to hire her anyway, is the agent who draws the story to its surprising conclusion. Lies begat lies that begat lies, et cetera.<br /><br />The major impact of this intrigue is the manner in which the isolated tragedy impacts each of the characters involved. Each changes in a dramatic way. ████ █████████ gives the finest performance of a career filled with brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than about any actor before the audience today. Likewise the gifted █████ ██████ adds yet another fine role to her repertoire as does the surprisingly smarmy ██████ ███████ who, despite being yet another wealthy British 'gentleman', gives us a man both arid of spirit and yet ultimately needy. And the always-fine █████ ███████ takes a small role and finesses it making her character quietly central to the chaotic web of lies.<br /><br />The cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts and the musical score by █████████ ████████ add immeasurably to the multiple atmospheres the story encounters. This is ensemble playing at its finest, which always means that the director (██████ ████████) has a fine grasp on the piece. The interplay of these fine people makes the dodgy story work very well indeed. █████ Harp
