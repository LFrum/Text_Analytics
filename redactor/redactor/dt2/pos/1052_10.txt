"█████████ in Connecticut" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for █████████! █████████ ████, a precursor to ██████ ███████, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. Only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. Her publisher, ███ █████████ ███████ (a brilliant comic turn by ██████ ███████████) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to █████████'s "perfect farm" for the █████████ holiday. Only thing, there is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. The comedy involves how █████████ is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job. █████████'s colleague, ████, happens to have a farm in Connecticut, so that solves that problem. However, he wants to marry ███, but she does not want to marry him. He offers her marriage, though he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him that he does about her. He makes the offer anyway, and assures her that he is willing to wait. And here ███████ ████████, as ███, delivers one of the most devastating put-downs I have ever heard. With perfect innocence, she replies: "Could you wait that long?" OUCH! In addition, the scenes between ███ ████████ and S.Z. Sakall are hilarious. They don't seem to like one another (though one suspects they really do). They are rivals in the household, and S.Z. Sakall's mangled English is equaled by ████'s strangled pronunciation of his name ("███ ██████████"). "My name is FELIX!" It is amazing how █████████-y these black and white films are. Great character work by all involved. Don't miss this one!
