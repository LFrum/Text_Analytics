It took a loan out film to Columbia for ████ █████'s home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. █████ ████ also became ████ ████████'s signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II.<br /><br />█████ plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where ████ is a featured dancer and ████ ███████ the comic. Of course █████ does a bit of hoofing himself there.<br /><br />████████ comes to the attention of millionaire ████ ██████ when it turns out that ██████ had loved and lost ████████'s grandmother. In some flashback sequences from the gaslight era, ████████ also plays her own grandmother with ████ ██████ playing the young ██████. You might remember ████ ██████ was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead, █████ ███████.<br /><br />Broadway producer ███ ██████ also is attracted to ███████, but he's not interested in nostalgia. He wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies revue and in fact the biggest number of █████ ████ is the title song of the film. It's nicely done in Follies style.<br /><br />████████ also gets to sing A Sure Thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by ██████ ████ and Ira Gershwin, ████████ also does an old English music hall number ████ ████. When I say sing, as everyone knows ████ mouths words. Singing here is done by ███ Wynn.<br /><br />The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and ███ ████ which is introduced by ████ █████. It was one of the biggest hits of the World War II era and one of the biggest sellers ██████ ████ ever wrote. It happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this September. Long Ago and ███ ████ was nominated for ████ ████, but lost to Swinging on a Star.<br /><br />What really sets █████ ████ apart and what makes it a milestone film for ████ █████ is the two numbers Put Me to the Test and the Alter Ego number. █████ ████ decided to do what █████ ██ █████ had refused at MGM, to give █████ creative control of his own material. █████ later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career. In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. <br /><br />In fact after one more loan out film, █████████ Holiday at Universal, █████ ██ █████ never loaned out ████ █████ for the rest of the time he was at MGM. And he did get creative control from then on.<br /><br />With that dazzling technicolor cinematography and ████'s red hair and ████ █████'s boundless creativity, █████ ████ was and is a classic and will forever be so.
