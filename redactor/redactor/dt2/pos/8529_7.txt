The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two rival ████ films. "Octopussy", starring █████ █████, was part of the official █████ ████████ ████ franchise. "Never ███ █████ █████", made by a rival producer, is, apart from the awful "██████ ██████", the only ████ movie which does not form part of that franchise. Its big attraction was that it brought back the original ████, ████ ███████; its title reputedly derived from ███████'s remark after "Diamonds Are Forever" that he would never again play the role. Some have complained that ███████ was, at 53, too old for the role, but he was in fact three years younger than his successor █████, who not only made "Octopussy" in the same year but went on to make one further ████ film, "A View to a Kill", two years later.<br /><br />The film owes its existence to the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to ███ ███████'s work. It is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the settlement included a clause that the new film had to be a remake of "Thunderball", as that was perhaps not the greatest of the ███████ ████s. (A remake of "Dr No" or "Goldfinger" might have worked better). The plot is much the same as that of the earlier film; the terrorist organisation SPECTRE, acting together with a megalomaniac tycoon named █████, have stolen two American nuclear warheads and are attempting to hold the world's governments to ransom by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a vast sum of money. It falls to ████, of course, to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles.<br /><br />The film is fortunate in that it has not just one but two of the most beautiful ████ girls of all, ███████ ███████ as the seductive but lethal ██████ █████ and ███ ████████ as █████'s girlfriend ██████ who defects to ████'s side after learning of her lover's evil plans. A number of the ████ films have a plot that hangs upon the hero's ability to win over the villain's mistress or female accomplice- there are similar developments, for example, in "Goldfinger", "Live and Let ███" and "The Living Daylights". In the official series, ████'s ally is normally regarded as the female lead, but here ███████, playing the villainess, is billed above ████████, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. ████████, of course, has gone on to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, whereas ███████ is one of a number of ████ girls who have somewhat faded from view.<br /><br />Of the villains, ███ von Sydow makes an effective ███████, the head of SPECTRE, but █████ █████ █████████ seemed too bland and nonthreatening as █████, except perhaps during the "Domination" game, a more sophisticated variant on those violent computer games such as "█████ ████████" that were so popular in the early eighties. █████████ can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films such as "Mephisto" and "██████ ████", but he does not comes across so expressively in English.<br /><br />One of the film's features is that it both follows the normal ████ formula and, at times, departs from it. There is the standard world-in-peril plot, chase sequences, a series of exotic locations, glamorous women, sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film's title. There is, however, no extended pre-credits sequence, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, ████'s boss M becomes a languid, supercilious aristocrat, his American colleague █████ ██████ is shown as black for the only time, and the scientist Q is portrayed by ████ ███████ as a disillusioned cynic with (despite his characteristically upper-class Christian name of Algernon) a distinctly working-class accent. There is also an amusing cameo from █████ ████████ as a bumbling British diplomat. Although ███████ was perhaps not quite a good here as he was in some of his earlier films in the role, this ringing the changes on the familiar theme makes this one of the more memorable ████s. 7/10 <br /><br />A goof. █████ ████████'s character states that he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. As, however, the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Britain would have a High Commission in its capital, not an Embassy.
