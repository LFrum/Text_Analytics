since the plot like ███████ or Brian DePalma's Obsession, till to the score by █████ █████ that reminds the sounds of ███████ ████████, this little pearl seems to be sight from fews. Remarkable playing by ██████ █████████ and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris portrayed from the famous ███████ ████████. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD are the french one and the English. Directed by a controversial artist as ██████ ███████, it could be considered a little homage to the Cinema masterworks. It is a french movie, and as all of them, not for all, we could say a d'essai cinema. Even if not so publicized, it could be remembered for several reason.
