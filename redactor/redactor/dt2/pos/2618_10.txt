right the hospital scene with █████ and ███████ was done brilliantly it starts off with █████ On A gurney looking very badly injured, the docs race her into a resuscitation room & they move her from the gurney onto a bed and ████ █████ ███ ████ from that point on it is obvious that █████ is having a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing, as she turns to beg of Prue to not leave her side she gaps "don't go i love you and then her pulse drops and she goes into cardiac arrest & the monitor shows a clear flat line & the nurses go into full out trauma mode & bring in a defibrillator ████ █████ back from the bed in horror as the doctors desperately try to shock her dying sisters heart but there is no response and she is tragically pronounced dead well great scene well done girls
