████ and the Tramp II is very colourfully animated, and the songs, especially that of the Junkyard Dogs, are quite good. However, the family seems even too idyllic, and I can't help understanding that █████ is discontented when everything is forbidden. However, I also pity Angel who never has had a loving family until she meets ███ dear and Darling.<br /><br />In any case, it's clear that the original ████ and the Tramp is better than this sequel.
