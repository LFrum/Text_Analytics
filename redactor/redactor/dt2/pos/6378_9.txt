I saw ████ ██████ in 1993 telecasted in Doordarshan on a Friday night, and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in Bollywood. It was mind blowing  a film with a "modern" storyline, superb music, three lovely ladies and my fave superstar ███ Anand.In this unusual storyline, ███ falls in love with three women  the simple Nanda, the ravishing ███████ and the sophisticated Simi. They too are enamored with him and want to marry him. This puts ███ in a dilemma (which is the crux of the storyline)- whom to marry?. He consults a hypnotist who asks ███ to gaze into a crystal ball. ███ finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (most probably by ███ saheb himself & not by Amarjeet the official director) the B&W classic has evergreen music  some of SD Burman's (helped generously by RD Burman) best compositions. "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in Hindi films. Credit should also be given to ███████ ██████████ for penning the memorable lyrics ████ ██████ is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of ███ Anand and he did full justice to the role. Unfortunately ████ ██████ has never received the recognition & popularity it richly deserves.<br /><br />A must see for any Hindi film buff, I will rate the eternal favourite 9.5 out of 10.
