Despite this production having received a number of poor reviews, it actually holds up quite well for its age. Note also that it is not a BBC programme, it was simply licensed to them by ███████ ████████ when the Jane Austen collection was released on DVD.<br /><br />So how does it compare with other adaptations of the same novel? The most well-known version these days is the 1995 film with ██████ ████ as ████ ███████ and ██████ █████ as ███████ █████████ █████████. That film was of course shorter but a good snapshot of the story - the earlier version, with ███ ███████ and █████ ████████ in the same roles, had four hours to tell the story and moved at a more leisurely pace.<br /><br />Firbank is a good ten years too old for her role, but she is very good - Marshall is excellent as Wentworth, a man disappointed in love, and bitter about interference. And hidden in the cast are people who also contribute - ███████ ██████, later seen in Cadfael, as ███████; ███████ ██████, later seen in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, as Admiral Croft; ████ █████, earlier in Coronation Street, as ███ Musgrove.<br /><br />One criticism I do have is that the hairstyles are a bit distracting, and that the costumes are awful! Still, this shouldn't detract from a hugely enjoyable Austen adaptation.
