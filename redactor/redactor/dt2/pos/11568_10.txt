After the success of "Muppet Babies" Warner Brothers chalked up "Tiny Toons". But instead of making ████ █████, █████ ████ and all the rest of the ████ey Toon gang kids, they created new animal characters who were kids with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless mirrored their predecessors. The leads included ██████ & ████ █████ (no relation, which became their running gag or catch phrase), ██████ ████, ███████ ███, █████ █████, ███████ 'the' ████, ██████, ███████ ███, Furball, ██████, the rats and assorted animals of ████████ ████, and the original ██████ █████ cast themselves. The "Tiny Toons" lived in Acme Acres and attended ████ ████████████, where the ████ey Toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors to the younger generation the ins and out of comedy.<br /><br />During the show's run, various pot shots were taken at the Bush SR. administration, pop culture, and coupled with various other gags and spoofs.<br /><br />██████ & ████, arguably the show's main characters, as mentioned above, were similar to ████ █████ in some respects, but they also had their own differing personality ticks and comic styles, namely, ████' tendency to impersonate anyone and everyone, while ██████, capable of being a great goof himself, usually played straight man (or straight rabbit) to ████' antics. ██████ ████ was a virtual copy of █████ ████ (not screwball █████ but egomaniac █████), with nearly as big an ego as █████ and just as much of an obsession with upstaging the ██████ & ████ as █████ had with upstaging Bugs, though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempts, yet he remained strangely endearing through out. ███████ was an even more shy version of Porky Pig, and he had the thankless job of playing Porky to ██████'s █████. ███████, the blond duck gal, was a new age valley girl type whom ██████ would go in and out of phases of mocking or vying for her affections. █████ was the purple version of the Tasmanian Devil. Furball was the silent Sylvester and ██████ was the pink ███████ bird. There was also the purple female skunk who longed for a boyfriend and the pint sized versions of ████ ██████ and the Road Runner. ████ was defined in the form of ███████ ███, a rich kid who was always out to make a buck or make people's lives miserable. There was also ██████, a deranged animal lover whom everyone feared. And then there was ████ ████, an odd thing-a-ma-gig creature who had no clearly designated species except that he was from "█████ ████" or something like that.<br /><br />Pop culture references included Batman (quite frequently actually), ███████ ███████, ███████ ███, Dances With ██████, ███████ █████, ████ ████, █████████, fast food joints, the Ten Commandments, the Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Live and even the Simpsons, among others.<br /><br />Not only funny, but it also managed to be warm and touching, something it's successor "Animaniacs" never quite attained. Also followed by "Taz-Mania".
