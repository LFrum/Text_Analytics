The Hand of Death aka Countdown in ████ ██ (1976) is a vastly underrated early work by director ████ ███. The film stars ██████ ███ (███ Tao-liang) and features ██████ ████, █████ ████ and █████ ████ in significant supporting roles. Many people believe, or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising, that this is a ██████ ████ film. This is not a ██████ ████ film, ██████ ███ is the star but ██████ gives one of his best (most serious) early performances.<br /><br />The Hand of Death is about a Shaolin disciple named ██████ (███) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a Shaolin traitor named ████ ████████ (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named █████ ██ (Woo). Along his journey ██████ meets up with a young woodcutter named ███ (████) and a disgraced sword fighter (█████ █████) known as "the wanderer." Both men have suffered at the hands of ████ and want to take revenge. The three team up to defeat ████ and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety.<br /><br />The martial arts action is above average under the direction of █████ ████. ██████ ███ uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the "Northern eighteen styles kicks" along with some "Southern five styles boxing." █████ ████ and ██████ ████ provide excellent martial arts performances as well. █████ ████ is not the greatest martial artist on the Jade screen but does an acceptable job. Some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring ████, ███ and Hung are very good.<br /><br />Director ████ ███ provides plenty of interesting character development in the film, which is refreshing. The cinematography by █████ ████ ███ is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. ██████ Koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70's "█████" style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best. Hand of Death is not ██████ and █████'s usual kung fu comedy. Hand of Death is a serious, straightforward revenge driven story.<br /><br />Hand of Death aka Countdown in ████ ██ is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from ██████ ████ and █████ ████. Hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and ████'s early charisma and talent can be clearly seen.<br /><br />Hand of Death is a solid, stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary ████ ███.<br /><br />████ ██ Genre Rating 7.5/10 <br /><br />Wanderer to ███ (referring to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance." <br /><br />███: "Just a knickknack."
