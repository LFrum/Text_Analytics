I am a big fan of this film and found the TV mini series "Children of The Dust", the version fans should look for. At least 20 minutes or more are cut on the DVD version of this film.<br /><br />I would also suggest viewers who enjoyed this film to check out the book there is a more rounded storyline with Corby/Whitewolf and Rachel, more on █████ ███████ and ███████ ███████. There were two many storylines for the series or this film.<br /><br />Sidney ███████ only shows he gets better with age, the talent just keeps growing the chemistry between his character of █████ █████ and ██████ ██████ were wonderful viewing. I also enjoyed the █████ █████/Joanna Going storyline, they seems to play off each other well.<br /><br />█████ █████ is of course the "Model of Indian Vision". The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who was wanted to be carried off in one of those romance novels by a native hero. Worked for me also.<br /><br />Much more could have been done with this storyline but it did give the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems back in the 1880's, white take over of native schooling, lack of Black pioneers to setup towns in the west. ███████ Moriarty (Maxwell) as always a great actor comes across as a very caring and confused teacher, not sure if the "whites" should be interfering with native culture.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoys characters and watching them change this film is for you. I thought the chemistry between ███████'s character and that of the orphan Whitewolf very moving and thought █████ and ███████ worked very well together. █████ █████ did some of his best scenes when working with ███████.<br /><br />Going got on my nerves sometimes when you want to just stop and shake her or give her a " wake-up and grown-up" call. But on the whole it was a great evening of entertainment.<br /><br />Look for the two tape version of this mini series if you are a fan you will really see the difference.
