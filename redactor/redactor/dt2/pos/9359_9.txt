A March 1947 New York Times article described █████████ as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to "face questions of racial and religious prejudice with more forthright courage than audiences have been accustomed to expect." While RKO was producing █████████, █████████ ███████████ was making █████████'s Agreement, another story about antisemitism. RKO raced to beat the much "ballyhooed" ███ picture to the theaters, releasing █████████ several months before █████████'s Agreement. In July 1947, RKO screened █████████ for representatives of various Los Angeles religious groups. In addition, several surveys, which were designed to gauge the audience's prejudices, were conducted before and after screenings of the film. █████████ received both praise and criticism for its depiction of antisemitism in America and was the subject of many editorials. █████████ received an ███████ █████ nomination for ████ Picture, but lost to █████████'s Agreement. It was also nominated for ████ ██████████ █████ (██████ ████), ████ Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), ████ ████████ and ████ ██████████ (Adaptation). In September 1947, █████████ was named ████ ██████ ████ at Cannes. In December 1947, █████ magazine, an African-American publication, gave the film its annual award for "improving interracial understanding." Loved this movie. If you get the chance to watch it, see it.
