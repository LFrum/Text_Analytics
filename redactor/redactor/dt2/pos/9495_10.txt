I loved this film. It manages to make the characters sympathetic (well, most of them) concerning the problems they have with their relationship.<br /><br />Gloria ███████, as █████, is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely notices her presence (though he does notice her absence). The film shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is susceptible to a sweet-talking con man, without making her selfish or demanding. The reaction shots of █████ at the dinner table on her anniversary, while her workaholic husband (late to dinner again) eats salted scallions with gusto and pushes bride-and-groom dolls out of the way of his plate, are perfect.<br /><br />The show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by ███████ ██████ as ███, █████'s neglectful husband. After losing █████ to another man, ███ literally cleans up his act, shaving off his mustache, working out to lose the middle-aged spread, and dressing neatly. There are several shots of ███ at home, lonely and thinking of █████, including a powerful scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet. The film gives the audience the advantage of watching ███'s transformation along with █████. It isn't just the exterior that's more attractive; we come to know much more about the kind of person ███ really is, and we see how completely different he is from █████'s second husband, ████████ (███ ████). Dexter shines as the before-and-after ███, who is determined, after discovering ████████'s true character, to win █████ back, if he can. The film's most touching moment comes when ███ and █████ discover that they are standing under the mistletoe, and ███ talks of what he has lost.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching.
