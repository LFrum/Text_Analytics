Very good 1939 film where ████ ████████ plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. Trouble is that the killer and ████████'s girl, ███ ████████, in a brief but good performance, get killed while trying to elude the police.<br /><br />A crooked attorney persuades ████████ to flee N.Y. He lands in Arizona and meets up with the Dead End Kids.. They've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble.<br /><br />Of course, ████████ finds a new love interest but must conceal his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash.<br /><br />May ██████ is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the wayward youth. ██████ █████ is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that ████████ is still alive and pursues him when a picture is snapped of him in Arizona.<br /><br />The film really deals with ████████'s relation to the boys. While the ending is good, you want to see ████████ go back to N.Y. to proclaim his innocence.
