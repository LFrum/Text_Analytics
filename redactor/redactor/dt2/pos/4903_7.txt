Although a "woman's story," I found this still fairly interesting. It is unusual in that is has three real-life sisters playing sisters in the movie! I am referring to █████████, ████████ and ████ Lane.<br /><br />Why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad-boy-rebel ████ ████████. In their twisted Liberal-dominated minds, All-American characters are sickening but sour-on- life, poor-attitude types like ████████ played here are people they can identify with. Despite that, this movie still has an overall feeling of goodness, which is why I liked it. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, but they good hearts. Whose heart was bigger than "███'s" (█████████ Lane) in here? I agree with the IMDb user comments critic in here who says this is █████████'s film as much as the beloved (not by me) ████████'s. <br /><br />With a director the caliber of ███████ ██████, the film is better than it might have been under someone else. ██████ made sure no scene, soapy or otherwise, went on too long.<br /><br />In addition to the Lane sisters and ████████, we have ██████ █████ (who adds much-needed humor to the story), ███████ ████ (the main love interest of the girls), ████ ████, ████ █████, █████ ██████ and ███ Robson.<br /><br />Apparently, this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin-offs from it, neither of them approaching this one in content and box-office success.
