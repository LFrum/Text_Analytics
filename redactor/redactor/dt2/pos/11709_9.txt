██████'s ███████ is easily one of ████ ████████ best efforts. It also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas. Erotic and violent, the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in ███████, and delivering a chaotic detective case, to you(the viewer), on a silver platter. Dedicated and determined, ██████ must stop the murder of Dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, who's clientel is anything but ordinary. Before long, ██████'s crimefighting ███████ uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order, which threatens to corrupt the inner body of ███████. As a resident of Metro ███████, I recall the excitement in town during the movie's production. ██████'s ███████ goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of ███████. Twenty years removed and 2,000,000-more people later, the film stands the test of time. Trust me, ███████ has not changed. One of the highlights of the picture is ███ ████████'s daring stunt(a classic, symbolic ending). It was even featured on That's Incredible, ABC's reality show of the period. It's just too bad that █████████ does not make enough films like this one. ████ back, each your popcorn, and watch sterling silver cinema action.
