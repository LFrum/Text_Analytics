I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced █████ ██████ & ██████ █████ were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced ██████ █████████ was a disabled actor and pretty sure █████ ██████ was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!! I can remember all the acclaim ██████ ████████ got back in the 80's for his portrayal of autism in the film 'Rain ███' - quite frankly (in my opinion of course!)██████ █████████'s performance/portrayal blows ██████ ████████'s right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such!! All in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship/love/relationships ever - and it was made in Britain/Ireland with home grown actors - stick that in yer pipe and smoke it Hollywood!
