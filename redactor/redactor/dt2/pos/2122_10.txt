█████ ████████ is a bit old fashion at first glance. ██████ Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said it best "If ████ ██████ had hailed from Texas, he would have made █████ ████████" <br /><br />The movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul. The kids are great and the array of stars is incredible. I bet █████ ██████ and █████ ███████ are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see:) (G rated) <br /><br />This is a masterfully crafted "simple" little film made in Texas by █████ █████ ████. Take your kids, take your kids friends, take ███████ too....they will all enjoy it and you will too.
