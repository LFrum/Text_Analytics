I haven't actually seen a lot of movies with █████ ██████, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a hard-nosed journalist, ████ █████, who has devoted all of her time to TV news show. Her colleague █████ ██████ has carried her torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by ███ ████████. He is the slightly aloof ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter. To ████, he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - turning it into edutainment, not serious business. Much to her surprise, ████ finds herself attracted to ███.<br /><br />█████ ██████ is doing a great performance as the perky journalist. But I don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, ███. It's something with them that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him. Almost as impressive is ██████ ██████, who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his job but doesn't get quite as much in return. Actually, for a while I thought he was █████ ██████████ from Police Academy (1984). He has a few funny lines and if this was a Meg Ryan-picture, they'd call it a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Running over two hours, a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely, eg. ████'s and █████'s trip to Central America. Also, I'm a sucker for happy endings and had preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later.
