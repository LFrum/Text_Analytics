I believe, that this is a heart tugging film. ███████ Donner (Directed the top grossing film "Superman"), had done a great job directing this film. Some of the segemets were good, and several were horrible because, █████ (Mazzello) was beatened by The King (███████, and especially their dog, █████ attacked the King which meant that he paid for what he had done to █████.<br /><br />██████ ████, portrayed a good role in this film. The memorable scene in this, he dreamt that he took the buffalo's advice about █████ being battered. ████████ Bracco, (Pre-Soprano)had portrayed an impressing role.<br /><br />I give this film *** out of four!!!
