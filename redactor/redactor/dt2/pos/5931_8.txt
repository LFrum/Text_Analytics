Probably the best █████ ██████ in years.<br /><br />Match 1 sees Edge battle █████ ████████ in a good but very long match. Next up one of the worst wrestlers on the roster - ███████████ takes on The Undertaker in a boring casket match. Match number 3 sees ████████ defend his WWE title against Big Show and ████ █████ in a surprisingly good contest. The next match up sees ██████ █ defending his 10th heavyweight title reign against █████ █████ in a great match up.<br /><br />Next up the █████ ██████ takes place in which 15 Raw superstars and 15 █████████! superstars hit the ring to try and win the rumble and face the champion whoever that may be at Wrestlemania 21. Highlights included █████ ██████ 3 winner ██████ █████ getting his ass kicked by █████ ██████, █████ ████████ and ████████ █████! All of the superstars beating the crap out of Muhammad Hassan, and Raw superstars vs █████████! superstars!<br /><br />Not a bad PPV at all.<br /><br />Edge vs HBK - 8/10 Taker vs ███████████ - 4/10 JBL vs █████ vs Big Show - 7.5/10 ██████ █ vs Orton - 8.5/10 The █████ ██████ match - 9/10
