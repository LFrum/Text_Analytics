I had such high hopes for ████████ █████ to air this but instead of having shows such as this, ones that don't get the treatment that they deserve, they air things that I may have seen dozens of times before.<br /><br />The Centurions was the highlight of my pre-teen years. I know that may seem a little bit clichéd but it's true. After ████ from G.I. ███, ████ █████████ is another one of those cartoon characters that I really had a crush on.<br /><br />It's too bad that ████████ █████ doesn't see it the same way people of my generation do. Otherwise ████████ █████ would be a lot better than it is.
