My Architect is a great film about █████████ ████'s search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, █████ ████, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.<br /><br />I had never heard of █████ ████ prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work. Through the words (both good and bad) of █████ ████'s colleagues, you get a very good sense of what █████████ must have felt as memories are recalled and stories retold. Sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling █████████ how to feel about his father. As I listened to each recollection, my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible, sometimes in the span of a moment, so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that █████████'s emotions must have been riding.<br /><br />The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made the film for me. The reverence of which the people of Bangladesh spoke of █████ ████'s work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me, and, hopefully, for █████████.<br /><br />I think █████████ ████ finally found what he was looking for.
