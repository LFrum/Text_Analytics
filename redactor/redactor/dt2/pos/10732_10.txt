I've seen many ██████ ███████'s movies like █████ ████ or ████ ███ and I liked them, but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons. I expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in █████ ████, but I saw a totally different person. He was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of ██ ██████ in Serpico. The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. I liked the way ██████ ███████'s character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son. This movie is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.
