I suspect there are several cuts of this doco doing the rounds. The copy I saw focused heavily on ███'s erotic films and referred to his horror output in passing. There are numerous X-rated films presented in their X-rated glory and EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA'S legendary "snuff" footage (the breasts being cut off) is given generous screen time.<br /><br />The interviews with the highly likable ███ are informative and candid. He is an unassuming, articulate gent and discusses his interest in shocking audiences, why he wanted to mix erotica with horror, and how he may have been responsible for one of his performers turning gay.<br /><br />His friendship and working relationship with Indonesian beauty █████ ██████ is touched on, as is his indifferent attitude to shooting hardcore.<br /><br />███ ███████ personifies an incredible period in Continental cinema that has now passed. It is great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine, unique work.<br /><br />RIP, ███.
