If you are among the IMDB audience that put ████ ████████ in the all-time top 200, then this movie probably is NOT for you. This film is as unhip as █████ ██████ is self-consciously hip. █████ █████████ is excellent as a hip urbane magazine writer who returns to her suburban █████ ██████ nest in order to care for mother Streep (who delivers yet another hall-of-fame performance). ███████ Hurt is ideally cast and the feckless, faithless, and egotistical husband. If this movie doesn't move you to cry and laugh, then you are much too hip to enjoy it.
