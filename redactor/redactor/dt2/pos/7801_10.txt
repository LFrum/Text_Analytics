█████ ████ ████ is a movie that I treasure and its one movie, I don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I do put it over ████ █████... reason? ████ █████ has scenes you'll watch out but █████ ████ ████? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! █████ & ██████ share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism: <br /><br />Rank # 1. █████ ██████ ████ (██████ ██████'s best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): ████ is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of ███████ (███ █████ fame). █████ ██████ ████ is actually ███████'s nephew but for ███████, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. ████, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to ████ (who is as █████ had once said, "A Fraud and a Cheat!"). Now, ████'s only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, ████ realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... ████'s struggle against the sinner-world.<br /><br />Rank # 2. ████ (████ Main Hoon, ████ █████ ███!): ████ is an evil character who is ███ █████ █████'s twin. Originally named █████ █████ █████, ████ chooses to change his name to suit his personality. ████, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to ███ █████. ████ decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed ██████ ██████ ███████ (███████'s Dad), though ████ doesn't regret his actions. ████'s sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry & ██████ ████. ████ also needs to return back the loan to ████ (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). In order to achieve his evil goals, ████ employs two people: ██████ (█████ █████, who is very good at aiming) and █████ (███████ ████, ████'s clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) <br /><br />Rank # 3. ████ (█████ ████): Wants to marry the rich heiress ███████, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for ██████. ████, has no problem taking care of the big business that ███████'s father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London, if needed.<br /><br />Rank # 4. ████ (██████ ████): After ████, ████ is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way ████ tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more characters because █████ ██████! I just wouldn't stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.<br /><br />The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered between ████ and █████ ██████ ████ (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. █████ ████ ████ is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would ████ ask ████ to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though ████ was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). █████ ████ ████ is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where ██████ is targeted by █████ and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where ████ reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to London and the part where ████ is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. █████ ████ ████ is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!<br /><br />The movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling ████ ████ and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!
