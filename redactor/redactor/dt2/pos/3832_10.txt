This is one of the best of the early "████ ████" episodes, with ████ and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! █████ ███ ██████, well-played by ████ ████, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the "████ ████" universe. His barely disguised hatred of ███ █████ is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of ████ or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of war-time paranoia is all too real. Then there's the Romulans: they're the ultimate Federation nemesis. The Klingons are nasty but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean business: they're the ancient Romans reborn in the space age; in spite of their Vulcanoid features they're clearly meant to remind us of imperial Rome, with names like ██████ and titles like "centurion" and "praetor." The chain-mail armor is really cool. Familiar guest star ████ ██████, who went on to play █████'s dad █████ as well as the Klingon commander in "████ ████: the Motion Picture" is an appropriately grizzled, war-weary commander, a character who bears a striking resemblance to Laurence ███████'s Crassus in "Spartacus." Also, his questioning of the Empire's unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings ██████ ████████ (███████ ██████) expressed at the beginning of "Gladiator." A must both for Trekkies and sword-and-sandal epic fans.
