This episode of ███████ changed everything! The show is about to end it's third season, and all hell IS breaking loose in this episode. The ███████ ones bring an Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the manor the protect him from ████, The Sources assassin. When ████ attacks, he blasts in as a tornado and then corporealizes into his demon skin. He blasts ████ threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her. Then blasts █████ threw what is left of the wall. ██████ comes from the attic and says the vanquishing spell before ████ came kill the doctor. But being the Power of One, it just wounds him.███ comes to heal the other sisters and ████ wants to find ████ and destroy him for real. ██████, meanwhile is in the Underworld trying to find Cole.When ████ and █████ go out into the street to find the demon, the demon finds them. After their battle, the witches realize that a camera caught everything! When they get back to Manor trying to battle the media and after they vanquished ████, a a witch gone kookoo shoots █████. ████ uses her telekinesis to move people out of the way so she can get to the hospital. But they get their to late and █████ dies. And just when ████ is about to get shot, time is rewound to where they bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor. ████ blows in and blasts ████ and █████. But ██████ is still in the Underworld so ████ kills the doctor and blasts out of the Manor. When ███ finally comes, he can't heal ████. ████ is dead and so is the Power of Three. For Now. Personally. this episode was sad. ████ was the strongset of all of them. I would love to have her power of telekinesis. i really don't think ██████ should of went to the Underworld because if she didn't, ████ wouldn't have killed ████. But █████ brings The Power of Three together again and I'm happy with the show's progress
