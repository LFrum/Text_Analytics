1891: Stalwart, morally upright military doctor Lieutenant Claude de ████ (solid ███████ ██████████) and several other shipwreck survivors wash ashore on a remote tropical island that's governed with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic ██████ ███████ (superbly played to the deliciously slimy hilt by ███████ ███████), who lives on the island with the feisty Amanda Martin (a winningly spunky performance by the ravishing ███████ ████) and her unhinged rogue biologist father Professor ██████ ██████ (a marvelously dotty portrayal by ██████ ██████). Moreover, de ████ discovers that █████████ ██████ has control over a dangerous race of fishman beasts who are being exploited as slave labor by ███████. Director/co-writer ██████ ███████ relates the lively and absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, offers a flavorsome evocation of the lush and remote tropical setting, does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the spooky opening third, further spices things up with a nice line in dry humor, and stages the exhilarating action-loaded climax with considerable rip-roaring aplomb. While the central premise is obviously inspired by "The Island of Dr. Moreau," the story nonetheless is given a great deal of freshness and intrigue because of ███████'s artful melding of such diverse elements as voodoo, the lost underwater city of Atlantis, a rousing mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption, buried treasure, unscrupulous genetic experiments, and even some exciting rough'tumble fisticuffs between de ████ and ███████ during the thrilling conclusion into an altogether dynamic, imaginative, and often immensely entertaining whole. The sound acting by the sturdy cast qualifies as another substantial plus: ██████████ makes for a likable hero, ███████ essays his juicy villain part with supremely lip-smacking aplomb, Bach rates as a quite fetching damsel in distress, plus there are neat supporting contributions by █████ ██████████ as sinister voodoo priestess ███████, ██████ ████████ as the superstitious Jose, and ███████ █████ as surly troublemaker █████. █████████ Fernando's sumptuous widescreen cinematography delivers a wealth of striking visuals while ███████ █████████'s throbbing tribal score hits the funky spot. The amphibious humanoid fishman creatures are pretty gnarly-looking, too. An extremely fun flick.
