The problem with other actors cast in the rôle of ██████ Gray is that they either looked too old for the part (Hurd Hatfield, ██████ ██████, ████ ███████, █████ █████████, ███ ██████) or that they were unable to pull off the English aristocratic manner without being stilted. ██████ is the perpetual 19-year-old (or so), all milky skin and honey'd locks, as described by █████, so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part (i.e., who can portray the naivité, callousness, and manipulativeness), but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens. And █████ █████ pulls it all off in this excellent British TV adaptation.<br /><br />Gielgud as █████ ██████, while considerably older than what █████ had in mind, does wonders with his scenes--█████'s aphorisms have never sounded so natural and unforced. Especially ██████ ███████ in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison (and his costume didn't fit).<br /><br />Finally, ██████ █████ plays █████ as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, again a fitting interpretation. In general, the film includes enough gay subtext without turning ██████ himself gay--he's all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual perversion he hasn't tried in the 18 years covered by the story, but that makes him more narcist than homosexual. He seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here, as he should according to the novel.<br /><br />Of course the budget of this production was not very large, so everything feels a little stagey. Particularly ██████'s encounter with █████'s brother suffers from the obvious studio look. Also, the final shot of ██████ (a puppet I suppose) in his white toad-like make-up is more hilarious than convincing and █████'s death scene is inadvertently funny. (Also, as far as I recall, █████ should have been killed seated at the table.)<br /><br />But all in all, this is a very worthy adaptation. I'm sure █████ would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so much sex scenes, but █████'s decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxurious cloths, and precious gems isn't really explored here, i.e. the aestheticism is completely missing. But like "I, ████████", the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values.
