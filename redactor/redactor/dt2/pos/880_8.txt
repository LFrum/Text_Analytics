█████ █████ is *THE* crime thriller of Bollywood, and why should it not be? It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema █████ █████ ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):<br /><br />1 █████ █████'s direction 2 R D ██████'s music 3 ███ █████ 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 █████ █████ 6 Majrooh ██████████'s lyrics<br /><br />Even if █████ █████ is not a ████ Movie it definitely has bond babes. █████, ██████, and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.) But our sauvé █████ (███ █████) is anything but ████. He is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are. He even flirts with Anju (██████) trying to hit her romantic nerve, just so that he can get employed in her father's shop.<br /><br />███ █████ might be in a double role - well I don't want to spoil your movie or else I would have told you. That is what most of the mystery is about. ███ █████ works in a █████ry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work - though is not, or at least has a perfect alibi. We wonder who did it, is it ███ █████ as '█████' the person he claims to be or is it '████' someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike. Comes 'Shalu' (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims that he is her fiancé, in a tense situation ███ █████ has to prove that he is █████ and not ████. While everyone wonders if ███ █████ is █████ or ████ he is asked to remove his socks. ████ we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot. While we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold ███ █████ even finds time to joke. <br /><br />The real life brothers ████████ █████ █████ and █████ ███ █████ have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in Crime Thriller. <br /><br />There are moments of Hitchcock's North By Northwest, but the movies are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who, a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isn't a lot of similarity. ███ █████ could very well be ████ in addition to being █████. People have seen him, they identify him where ever he goes. There are too many of those people for this to be a fraud. Finally █████ thinks it is better to carry along with being ████ to find out what is the truth, and it is a sad mistake. He gets too deep into it, only to be saved by the twists of Cinema.<br /><br />When I watched the movie as a kid I was definitely not amused, the ending confused me completely. Even now there are parts about the ending that I do not like, but I'd recommend this movie anyway.<br /><br />Even as a kid I enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a definite loafers song in Kishor Kumar's voice. I could hear 'Rulake gaya ...' whole day long. Ditto for 'Aasmaan ke neeche' which is set 'under the skies' of Gangtok (at least the story line suggests that). 'Raat akeli hai' among the sexiest song to come out of Hindi cinema featuring ██████ as the seductress. 'Meri taraf dekho' - █████'s cabaret and we 'look at her'. 'Hothon pe ...' - now, could there be any better thriller of a song than this. As the song progresses we are more tensed than we ever were and the words 'hidden in Shalu's lips' add to it.
