spoiler--<br /><br />In 1993, African-American director/actor █████ ███ ███████ followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with "Posse". The film was co-written and directed by ███ ███████, who also stars as the main character, ██████ ███.<br /><br />Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, ██████ ███ finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J (███████ ███████), fast-talking Weezie (███████ ████) and the towering-but-simple Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it. However, the ambitious, bigoted Colonel ██████ (Zane) finds out about the gold, and is apparently willing to kill ██████ ███ and company for it. A shootout between the ██████'s forces and ██████ ███'s leaves the colonel blind in one eye, and his forces retreat. ██████ ███'s ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves (and the gold) back to New Orleans, but it turns out that ██████ isn't far behind. ██████ ███ and his allies are forced to go on the run, heading west, to a town called ████████████. Apparently, ████████████ was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War. ██████ ███'s father, "King █████", was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the town. However, as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks, King █████ was soon brutally murdered by a white mob, in a parallel of the Ku Klux Klan terror campaigns that began around the same time. ██████ ███ and company eventually find their way to ████████████, only to find that the townsfolk aren't exactly glad to see himespecially when ███████ █████ (███████ ██████) of a nearby white township makes it clear that he wants ██████ ███ and his partnersdead or alive. Carver (█████ █████████) is the sheriff and de facto mayor of ████████████and his own agenda may not square with having ██████ ███ around.<br /><br />Analysis The action sequences are all very credible, and █████ ███ ███████ turns in a good performance as the brooding hero. In the aftermath of the success of New Jack City, it was almost expected ███ ███████ would helm a sequel, or at least a similar urban-action follow-up. Instead, ███ ███████ looked 100 years into the past, creating a mostly-black Western (effectively 'updating' the black-themed Westerns of the 1970's), and continuing the legacy of largely-forgotten black-themed cowboy films from the early 20th century. Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently financed, and originally released through Gramercy/Polygram Entertainment. Allegedly, execs at the major studios balked when ███ ███████ pitched 'Posse' to them. Some of the more "curious" casting at the time involved rappers Big Daddy Kane and ████ ███ as ██████ ████ and █████, respectively. In certain interviews, █████ ███ ███████ has said that he often likes to cast against type; in the years since, the trend of casting rap singers in non-musical films would become almost commonplace. Keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities: Black-action film veterans like █████ █████ ("█████ ██████"), ███ █████ ("████ █████") and █████ ████ ("The Spook who Sat by the Door") show up, as does stand-up legend ██████ ███████, not to mention TV producer ███████ ██ ███████ (who hired the junior ███ ███████ to star in "█████ █████" years earlier). The film is bookended with █████ ██████ ("Spartacus") in a key role.
