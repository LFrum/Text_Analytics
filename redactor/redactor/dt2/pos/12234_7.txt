Now I like ██████ ███████. And I like ████ ██████ and █████ █████. But it would have been nice to see a real biography of ██████ ███████. ██████ Connolly as ███████ does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter years<br /><br />█████ and ██████ sing beautifully though. The ███████ music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers. █████'s ████ ██████ is a frail character, very similar to ███████ ███████ in Showboat who █████ also played.<br /><br />As for ████ ██████, it's a mystery why she never had a good Hollywood career. She did films with ████ ██████ and ████ ██████ as well as this one. She performed well, but movie audiences didn't take to her. The best musical moment in the film is █████ and ██████ in a duet of █████ █████. The recordings I have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet. There's also a pleasant scene with █████ and ██████ riding bicycles swapping ███████ songs as they ride.<br /><br />The real ██████ ███████ with his womanizing and his Irish patriot background and his musical training in Germany where he developed a love for all things German would have been a fascinating study. He was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing. I have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said ███████ ██████ would have been a good ██████ ███████. Sakall as Irish, HELLO.<br /><br />Nice movie, but the real ███ would have been so much better.
