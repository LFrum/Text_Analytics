After reading over all these reviews I'm very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 NBC cop show "█ █████" starring ███ ██████, i read reviews comparing it to "Dragnet" and some of the Quinn Martin police shows, but if you watch █ █████ you'll see it was based on it. In the late 1958 episodes of █ █████ onwards, you'll see ███ ██████ who plays Lieutenant Detective █████ █████████ get out of his car and then hes shot at,and he shoots back, the beginning of Police Squad is basically the same ( including the Jazz music) and then ███ ██████ narrates what goes on, (Im Lieutenant Detective █████ █████████,█ █████,a special department of the Chicago police) and in Police Squad ██████ ███████ does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant █████ ██████, Police Squad, a special division of the Police Department) and so on, in one of the █ █████ episodes there's even the Johnny the shoeshine guy character and in a █ █████ episode entitled " More Deadly" there's a Police Squad episode entitled "A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise)" which is the same story!
