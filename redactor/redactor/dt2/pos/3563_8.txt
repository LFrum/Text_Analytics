A gang of bandits lead by the shrewd, rugged, ruthless ████████ (a perfectly imposing performance by ███████ ██████) steals $300,000 worth of gold coins during a daring train robbery. But untrustworthy member Bahunda (an amusing turn by ████ ██████) makes off with the coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda gets killed before he can tell ████████ where he stashed the booty. So ████████ has to join forces with cunning, cocky, enigmatic bounty hunter the Stranger (smoothly played by the handsome ██████ ██████) and cagey, corrupt banker Clayton (a delightfully weaselly portrayal by 50's teen idol █████ "Kookie" Burns) to find the coins. Skillfully directed by ████ ██ ██████████, with a clever, complex and twist-laden script by ██████████, ████ █████, and ████████ █████████, a playfully amoral and nihilistic tone (everyone keeps double and triple crossing each other with happily greedy abandon), a twangy, flavorsome, spirited score by ██████████ ████████████ and █████████ ██ ████, plenty of stirring shoot-outs and rousing rough'n'tumble fisticuffs, a wickedly sly sense of self-mocking humor, a steady pace, and a real doozy of a surprise ending, this giddy and often hilarious feature makes for an inspired send-up of Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Popping up in nifty secondary parts are the luscious ████████ ███████ as ████████'s fiery gal pal ███████, █████ █████████ as a hard-nosed army captain, and ██████ ██████ as flinty lawman ████████ ████████. An immensely amusing and enjoyable romp.
