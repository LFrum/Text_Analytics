I found this movie to be extremely delightful.I am biased I suppose.I happen to adore █████ ███████ found her singing an added pleasure.She has a very nice voice.<br /><br />Ms Bates plays █████ Beasley.The film takes you from her doledrums married life in Chicago to England,the home of her recently murdered singing idol ██████ Fox.There she meets his three surviving uppity sisters.She also discovers that ██████ leaves behind a male lover,████ Simpson.<br /><br />The story leads you on to some surprisingly comedic and heartwarming situations as █████ and ████ develop a true fondness for each other,after an initial rather rude rejection,on his part.They return to Chicago where they team up with █████'s pint-sized,hilarious daughter-in-law,Maudie,to find the serial killer who murdered ██████.<br /><br />Everyone in the picture did a fine job.Particularly enjoyed █████ ███████,████ ████████ and █████ Manilow.This movie was fun.It makes you cry.The music is absolutely charming.<br /><br />Other posters here who found problems with any parts of this movie,just don't have a clue.<br /><br />
