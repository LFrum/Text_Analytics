█████ Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.Teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,████████ ████████, Eastwood delivers as only he can.Also,████ █████████ goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.As for ████ █████ as █████'s love interest,I think ████ ███████ said it best when he said,referring to his own career,"I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger".This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and ████████ should team together more often. Top notch movie.
