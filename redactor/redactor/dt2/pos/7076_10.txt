After renting One True Thing the other night, I have learned to respect my family, and not take their health for granted. I have never seen such a real-life portrayal of a cancer victim on screen like █████ delivered. She deserves the Oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the running. All I can say is █████████ film, great acting from ██████ and ██████████. █████ ██████ revealed her one true ability in this excellent film!
