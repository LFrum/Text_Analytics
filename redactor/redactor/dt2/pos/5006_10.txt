I am appalled and dismayed that the ███████ has canceled ████ ████ with █████ ████████ !!<br /><br />What is wrong with The ███ ██████████ ███████, Canceling ████ ████ With █████ ████████ and replacing it with █████ █████? For those at the ███████ with a short attention span, █████ At █████ was canceled because the audience grew tired of her nasty insults that would make the audience cringe, and █████ █████ spewing out her very own brand of vindictive mud slinging jokes is not humor, it is nasty and repulsive.<br /><br />Apparently The ███ ██████████ ███████ has rewarded █████ █████ because she has garnered a self important appearance front of President █████ █████. There is no doubt that █████'s recent ill tempered in front of the President of The United States are not funny and the audience laughter was only to patronize and please █████ █████.<br /><br />████ ████ with █████ ████████ has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindictively insulted any guest or performer. █████'s well rounded personality always gleefully, poked fun of life and himself.and his Filed Pieces during the first two seasons with AFTRA Actress Mary Mae Atwill, as the Mae West of the 21st Century were absolutely hysterical with █████ ████████'s skits:Judge ███ █████, Trading Spouses and Last ██████'s █████ █████ ███ ███████ where █████ chats with █████ via the Internet on the show. <br /><br />Despite the ███████'s budget constraints for elaborate field pieces and the Second ██████'s WGA Strike, █████ ████████ did not waiver his sense of humor or show integrity. ████ ████ with █████ ████████ always had up in coming new talent and his Comedy for Stoners spoofs of Nanny 911 and █████ █████████ were considered cutting edge and had excellent production value. <br /><br />On a professional level, █████ ████████, was the best Executive Producers, and ███ ████████, █████ ███████ along with his fabulous production crew were one of the best production teams that I have worked for in my AFTRA Career .It would really be very foolish and sad shame to cancel ████ ████ with █████ ████████. <br /><br />Unfortunately, its success could conceivably be taken to Comedy Central or another ███████ and Financially speaking, that would become a valuable revenue loss for FOX Television..<br /><br />On behalf of the late night Saturday ███ ██████████ audience, supporters of ████ ████ with █████ ████████, including all cast and crew, we beseech the ███████ to retain the ████ ████ With █████ ████████ Franchise and give the crew a second opportunity to become a successful ███ ████.
