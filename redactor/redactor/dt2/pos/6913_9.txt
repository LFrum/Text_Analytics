I thought ██████ ████ was fantastic as "████." I have seen her in "████ ██, Kate" and "Victor/Victoria," as well, and in each of these performances she has developed very different, and very real, characterizations. She is a chameleon who can play (and sing) anything!<br /><br />I am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding ██████'s performance in "████." Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal. So many people have focused on the fact that ██████ doesn't really look like ████. My response to that is, "So what?" I wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of ████. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And ██████ certainly gave us that, in great depth. I also didn't want to see someone simply "doing" classic ████ routines. Therefore I was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have ██████ portray ████ in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. (It seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits). This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart. I also thought ██████ was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes. And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the Professor and the Grape Stomping, in particular. There was one moment in the Grape scene where the corner of ██████'s mouth had the exact little upturn that I remember ████ having. I couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally.<br /><br />I wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the Lucille Ball of "I Love ████" throughout the entire movie. After all, those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what ████ was really like in her early movie years. I think ██████ showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant. She planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. ████ didn't fit the mold of the old studio system. In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts.<br /><br />I believe that ██████ deftly captured the comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sexiness, self absorption, childishness, and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon. And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing. "████" was a star turn for ██████ ████. I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future. I also hope it brings her an Emmy.
