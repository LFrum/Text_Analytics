I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. ██████ ███████ still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had ████ ████████, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played ██████, and the lady who played ███. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion. Also it was a great shame that ██████ ███████ had died, thereby leaving a gap so to speak. I only wish now that I had taped it to keep. Let's hope that they repeat it again.
