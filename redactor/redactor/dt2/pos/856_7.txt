█████████ █████ is going to be so ticked! Now, her book "Breaking Dawn" will not be first with that title. █████, ████████ fans.<br /><br />Kelly ███████ (The Ring Two) is medical student, ███, who is assigned to interview psychotic Don (█████ █████ - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the twist, and when she found out they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of it.<br /><br />She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared delusion going on. At times, she even acted like she had PTSD. I really thought she was losing it.<br /><br />Well, she wasn't losing it, and when the end came, I was floored. My whole suspicion turned out to be wrong. The twist was even more amazing than I believed.<br /><br />███████ was fantastic and the story is so much better than something █████████ █████ would come up with. A must see.
