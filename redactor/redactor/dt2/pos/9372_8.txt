"Crossfire" is remembered not so much for the fact that its three stars all had the first name "██████" but as being one of the first Hollywood films to deal with anti-semitism.<br /><br />The story opens with the murder in silhouette of a man whom we later learn is a Jewish man named ██████ ███████ (Sam Levene). Pipe smoking police ███████ ██████ (██████ █████) is assigned to the case. An ex-soldier, Montgomery (██████ ████) comes upon the murder scene and we learn through flashback that he had met ███████ in a bar along with other soldiers who were in the process of being mustered out of the service following WWII.<br /><br />According to Montgomery, he and pal █████ ██████ (█████ ██████) had followed ███████ and ███. ██████ ████████ (██████ ██████) to ███████' apartment for drinks. Montgomery tells ██████ that ████████ left the apartment first and that he and █████ followed soon after with ███████ still alive and well.<br /><br />Unable to locate ████████, ██████ suspects him of the murder. He enlists Sgt. █████ ██████ (██████ ███████) to help him locate ████████. ████████ meanwhile has been wondering the streets in a dazed state. He meets prostitute █████ (Gloria ███████) in a bar and strikes up a friendship. She gives him a key to her apartment and he goes there to rest. Unexpectedly a man (████ █████) turns up looking for █████. ████████, still in a daze, leaves and goes back to meet ██████ and his pals. ██████ manages to keep him from the police and hides him in an all night movie house.<br /><br />From ████████'s perspective we learn that Montgomery hates jews and is probably the killer. ██████ begins to focus his investigation on Montgomery trying to prove his guilt. He arrangers to have one of the soldiers, a kid named Leroy (███████ ██████) set a trap for Mongomery.<br /><br />"Crossfire" is considered to be one of the best of the "film noire" genre. In fact it garnered several ███████ █████ nominations including ████ and ███████ for best supporting actors. It was made on a modest budget in about three weeks.<br /><br />It has all of the elements of classic "film noire", the shadows, low key lighting and the story playing out mostly at night. The requisite "femme fatale" of the piece is ███████'s █████ who plays a minor role but is nonetheless your classic "femme fatale". The unnamed character played by ████ █████ (in an excellent bit) has been chewed up and spit out by █████ and was she about to do the same to ████████?<br /><br />██████ ████ steals the picture as the brutal Montgomery although it would type cast him in similar roles for years to come. ██████ █████ makes a good low key detective but ██████ ███████ has little to do other than befriend the ████████ character. Others in the cast are ██████████ █████ as ████████'s wife, ███ ██████ (who would go on the following year to play "Tarzan") as one of Mitchum's soldier pals and ███████ ██████ (who was previously known as ███ █████) as ██████'s assistant.<br /><br />Director ██████ ███████ would shortly run afoul of The House Un-American Committee as having communist affiliations and spend a couple of years in jail.
