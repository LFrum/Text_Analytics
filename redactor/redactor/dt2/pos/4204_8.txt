I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, ████ ████████ █<br /><br />████████ plays ████, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with ██████ ███████ and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? ████████ was an actor ahead of his peers. Before the term 'Method' was even coined and before ██████ ever screamed 'Stella!' he brings 'natural' to the screen. His earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. Also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that 'Golden Boy' role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen. ████████ looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting worth.<br /><br />███ ████████ is here in a small role at the beginning as ████'s trampy girl ██████. I haven't ever thought much of Sheridan, but I liked her here. She plays well off ████████. ███████'s' performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with ████████. The Dead End Kids are here, and ████████ seems their natural idol (even more so than Cagney). ██████ █████ is miscast, and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene. Strange, as he always was such a reliable actor.<br /><br />Also interesting to note is the director- █████ ████████, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. He maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably.<br /><br />A very good film that deserves greater attention 8/10.
