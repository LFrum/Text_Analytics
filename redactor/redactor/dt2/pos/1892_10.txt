I don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. It Was Great. ███████ █████ ████████, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a █████ movie for you watch it for █████. Also ███ ████ was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and entertaining I still crack up when I recall █████ on that pink moped. Now I will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear. But if you like slap stick and off the wall sci-fi plots this movie is for you.<br /><br />Hail The King ████!
