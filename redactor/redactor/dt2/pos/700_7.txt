This is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. It doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. Still, it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. It features former partners ████████ █████ and █████ ████ whose friendship is strong despite the fact that ████'s ████████ ██████ has been part of bank robbing(he even steals █████'s Sheriff Steve █████'s horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). In Red valley, █████ is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead. ██████ Trvor portrays Countess Maletta, a friend of ████████'s who gives he and buddy "█████"(Guinn 'Big ███' ████████)a place to stay for the time being. ████████ desires to go straight, but finds that hard when ████ ██████(███████ ██████)and his bad bunch want to rob ███ ██████'s bank. It is actually Jack who is behind the murders, but ████████'s troubled past is hard to get away from. He and █████ will be charged with the murders they didn't commit(the robbery was one ████████ didn't commit)and it will be █████ who must somehow save the day before ██████ gets away with murder. There are sub-plots which include ████████'s falling in love with ██████ ██████{██████ █████;the irony of the story is that ██████'s father, █████ ██████, is actually in cahoots with ██████ ███████ ███████(██████ ████)in a planned united theft with ██████ to steal the town of ███ ██████'s loot}. Will █████ uncover █████ ██████ and ██████ ███████'s treacherous scheme? Will █████ ██████ be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him? This film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout. Columbia couldn't have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such. Don't expect to get your socks blown off, but the film is simple and well paced.
