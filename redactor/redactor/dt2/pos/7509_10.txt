This movie is ██████ ██ █████ at his very best, ███████ ██████ at his very best and █████ ████ at her most pithy, and of course █████ ████████ writing at "masterpiece" warp! There are also very brief snippets of future biggies like █████ ████████, ████████ ████████ etc., who have one scene lines that you don't necessarily spot until your fifth or sixth time watching. █████ Marchand as a young to middle age nurse supervisor is also superb, as well as practically every "face" in Hollywood of 1970.<br /><br />It is one of the few movies that gets better the more times you see it. Watch for the "surprise" scene ala "Wait until ████"! This is one of the few movies I have ever bought on DVD. It is that superb.
