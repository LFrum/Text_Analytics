This show is amazing! I love each and every episode. ██████ is a spitfire and ████ is a lovable and at times a moron. Arthur, Spence, █████, ██████ and ██████'s Boss add just a nice end touch to the show, tying up all of the funny, pee in your pants moments. In one of the seasons, ████ tries to get ██████ drunk, because she is nicer when she is drunk. Nice husband right? ██████ isn't much better, when her boss needs a IPS driver to testify in a small case at her job, ██████ hesitates, because she views ████ as a slob and doesn't want him to embarrass her, so she hires ████'s friend instead. Wife of the year. But, who i believe to be funniest is yell-at-random Arthur. He is drop-dead hilarious, and angry. Hey, you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy. This show is hilarious, and if you haven't seen it yet, then you haven't lived!
