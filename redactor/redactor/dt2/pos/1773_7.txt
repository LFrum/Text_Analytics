This is one of several period sea-faring yarns of its era, which has the added distinction (although not in itself unique) of a female buccaneer at its center. At first, both leads – ████ ██████ and █████ ███████ – might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually, thanks no doubt to the talented players (███████ ████████, ██████ █████ and █████ █████████ Justice) who support them. Velvety-voiced Marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ship’s obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor, and █████ is suitably larger-than-life as ██████████ The Pirate.<br /><br />The cast is completed by █████ █████ as ███████’s wife, who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom ███████ instills the first pangs of love (which, however, does not spare him the occasional flogging or sword-wound); incidentally, the film was the second exotic teaming of ███████ and █████ in one year, following ██████ █████’ BIRD OF PARADISE. The direct result of this unexpected softening of ████’s character is her falling out with ██████████’s crew, and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded ███████, █████ and Marshall.<br /><br />While the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type, ███████ ████████’s energetic direction and █████ ██████’s grandiose score ensure an above-average effort that moves along at a brisk pace; incidentally, ████████ had already done service in the genre with the superior ████ █████████ vehicle, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950). As usual with vintage Technicolor productions, the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating. By the way, differing running-times are given for this film (81 or 87 minutes) and, for the record, the version I watched was the shorter one.
