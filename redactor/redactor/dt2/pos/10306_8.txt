I agree with ████, this is a good movie. █████ McKidd's character is believable throughout the film. We're forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him. █████ Sage who plays ███████ puts in a good performance too. It's thought-provoking and emotive without any slush over-production. Credit to director ██████ ███████ and writer ██████ ████ for that. A very worthwhile viewing. The pace of the film is just right, raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in, rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style. Nice little soundtrack to go with the film too, again used sparingly, not to distract you from storyline. Recommended.
