I have only see three episodes of ████, starring █████ █████, and it looks as though I've missed 37 episodes! well thats if ITV 3 are showing them in chronological order. I've just watched 'Misty ████' (episode 38). I have really enjoyed the 3 episodes, but then I'm a █████ █████ fan, (esp St. Elsewhere). For any one reading this, ████ is excellent. Pity its being aired on ITV 3. The cast is strong, though I cant get used to the idea of █████ playing a bent cop, still we all know he's the good guy wrongly accused. I see ████ ████ has guest starred, what ever happened to 'Midnight ██████'? Just wonder if ████ is available on DVD (yet). Lovin it. Cheers.
