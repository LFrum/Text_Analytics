The █████ █████████ Story shows a little more about singer █████ █████████'s complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.<br /><br />Cynthia Gibb (portrays █████) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb █████ █████████. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.<br /><br />██████ ████████ role as █████ █████████ is terrific, she does a great job as █████'s mother.<br /><br />It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they weren't, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in USA and other several countries
