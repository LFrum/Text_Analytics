███████ ██████████, a very wealthy man, has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral. Included in the funeral party is ██████████'s youngest sister ████ ████████. While none of the family has seen ████ in at least 20 years, they all agree that ████ was always a bit different. So when ████ says something about █████████ having been murdered, most laugh it off as one of ████'s eccentricities. But someone is obviously taking ████ seriously. The next day, ████ is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently. Is there a connection between the two deaths? It's up to ███████ ██████ to find a killer.<br /><br />After the Funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire ██████ series. I've always been a fan of this particular ██████ ████████ book and, from what I remember, the movie is as faithful to ████████'s source material as any of the ██████ installments. The mystery is top notch with plenty of clues, suspects, and red herrings. And as I've written before, I always enjoy an ████████ story where ███████ ██████ gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal. It might be old fashioned, but that's the way I like it. Getting beyond the plot, technically and artistically After the Funeral is a winner. Sets, editing, direction, and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies. The acting is equally impressive. I've come to expect an enjoyable performance from █████ ██████ as ██████ and he doesn't disappoint here. The rest of the cast is just as strong with ██████ █████ giving an especially noteworthy performance. Other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced, I've got no real complaints. It's a good show all the way around.
