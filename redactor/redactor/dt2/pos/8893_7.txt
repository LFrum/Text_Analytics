█████ ███████ is █████, a writer who hasn't written and is suspected of murder in "█████ █████ from the Train," costarring █████ ██████ and ████ ██████. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for this insanity, which is a take-off on █████████'s "Strangers on a Train." In fact, ████ (Devito) gets the idea of having █████ kill his mother in exchange for ████ killing █████'s ex from watching that famous film. "I saw the movie. Criss-cross," ████ tells █████. Not that █████ knows what he's talking about until it appears it's too late - just like "Strangers." █████, a writing teacher, claims that his ex-wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put her name on it. She has become a big celebrity, appearing on "█████," where she refers to █████ as "a beast." ████ is in █████'s class. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions of poisoning her, sticking a scissors in her head - you name it. It's not long after seeing "Strangers on a Train" that he's in Honolulu, stalking █████'s wife. While she's leaning over a boat railing trying to get an earring, ████ stands behind her and creeps up...Soon the police are looking for █████ to question him, but he's at ████'s where he's being encouraged to live up to his end of a bargain he had no idea he made. You know, "criss-cross." There are several scenes copied from "Strangers," which are hilarious. I especially loved █████'s confession to the sleeping Mrs. Lift, ████'s mother, similar to when ███ thinks he's talking to █████'s stepfather.<br /><br />███████ and DeVito are complete masters of comic dialogue and timing and will leave you laughing, often out loud. Ramsey is repulsively funny - a totally "out there" performance. ███ Griest and ███ ██████ also have roles - Griest is ███████'s girlfriend, and ██████ has what amounts to a cameo.<br /><br />The ending is very clever, and the whole film will leave you laughing.
