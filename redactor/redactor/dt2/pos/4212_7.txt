It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it. The ████ ███ ████/Bowery Boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films, and usually did better when in a support role, as in "Angels With Dirty Faces". Here, their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action.<br /><br />████ ████████ is light heavyweight champion ██████ █████████, a southpaw hitter who's a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press. When a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that ██████'s a party loving womanizer, his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from ██████'s manager ███ ████ (██████ ████████). In turn, ███ talks ██████'s girlfriend Goldie (███ ████████) into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter's death. As both flee, a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck, and ███'s body is misidentified as ██████ from the gold watch he was wearing.<br /><br />██████ █████ adopts an ██████ ██ ████████ sneer that doesn't quite work as a detective who's been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago. His character is █████ ██████, and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn't ██████. He pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him, and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way.<br /><br />Meanwhile, ██████ looks for advice from his lawyer, and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Making his way cross country, ██████ winds up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona, run by a crusty ██████ ████████ (May ██████). The farm is the legacy of Granny's brother, a deceased priest from Brooklyn, and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys (The ████ ███ ████) who work the farm. █████ Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one, and his sister █████ (██████ ███████) becomes the romantic interest for ██████, now going by the name of ████ ██████.<br /><br />I get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre-War era films. When ██████ and the boys take a joy ride in the farm's truck, they fill up at a gas station for a $1.28! Tommy (Halop) gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money, and with that thought, ████ ██████ decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering $500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him. The clichéd premise is turned on it's ear somewhat when ████ gets knocked out in the fifth round, but by then he's earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it's own. Maybe ███████ ████████ should have been in the ring, she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside. As ██████/████ comes around in the locker room, █████████ ██████ is on hand to take him into custody. Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar, it's a toss up as to whether ██████ follows through on his arrest - you'll have to watch the film to find out.<br /><br />I like the Dead End films where ███ ██████'s in charge, but he doesn't have a lot to do in this one. However he does a great film flam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match. Another thought - wouldn't it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of ███ ███████?<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty good entry in both the ████ ████████ and ████ ███ ████ filmography, and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half. If there's one downside, it's not enough screen time for pretty ███ ████████. The film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and ██████ ███████ were reversed, as the on screen chemistry between ███████'s █████ and ████ seemed more forced than natural.
