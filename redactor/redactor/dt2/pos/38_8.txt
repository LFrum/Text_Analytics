S. ██████ █████████ shines as █████ in this touching and vibrant look at the life of █████ ████████, Jr. (██████ ████████) while growing up under the guardianship of █████. The film gives a good character study of both █████ and █████ and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film. The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def, ████ ████, ████████ ██████ ██████, █████ █████, █████ ███████, Jr., ████ █████████, █████ █████, █████ ██████, ██████ █████, and ████████ ██████. Loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end, and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. But, overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by █████████.
