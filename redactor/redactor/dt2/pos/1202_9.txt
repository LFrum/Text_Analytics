The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960's Broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene. The stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers; however for the film director █████ ███████ (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more "user friendly" for the big screen. In the film, naive farm boy ██████ ██████ █████████ (████ ██████) is about to go into the army and decides to spend a couple of days in New York where he meets a group of aging hippies (█████ ████████, ██████ ██████, █████ ██████, ███ █████)who get him involved in a group of nutty misadventures, including the pursuit of a snooty society girl (Beverly D'Angelo). The story divides into a series of vignettes that range from the ridiculous to the sublime, but it is all gorgeously photographed with a clever use of NYC locations and imaginatively staged musical numbers (outstandingly choreographed by the legendary █████ █████). █████ ████████ lights up the screen as ██████, the unconventional and free-spirited hippie who does his best to get ██████ to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by ██████ as ██████, who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of ██████. █████ ██████ is a charmer as ███████, the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by ██████ or Dacus, doesn't know which one is the father and doesn't seem to care. There is one outstanding musical number after another here..."████████" is a tour through Central Park which includes dancing horses...█████ ████████ disrupts a fancy dinner party in "I Got ████"..."█████ Boys/White Boys" features the late Nell Carter and █████ █████ extolling the ethnic virtues of men and "Easy to be ████" is a powerful rendering of one of the best songs in the show by original cast member ██████ ██████, who plays ██████'s ex-girlfriend and mother of his child. This is a beautifully photographed, well-acted sung, and danced psychedelic acid trip of a movie that must be seen and once seen, will initiate multiple viewings as this dazzler has to much to offer to catch it all in one showing.
