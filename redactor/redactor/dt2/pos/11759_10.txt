█████████ is one of those movies which sort of fell through the cracks, but deserves better. When I first saw it, I had a luke-warm reaction. But, over time, it's really grown on me--no pun intended ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. The writing is top-notch, as is the acting. Throw in a few surprising cameos and good direction, and you end up with a great little film.<br /><br />It's also good to finally see ████ ██████ get a chance to shine in a starring role. And ████████ delivers his usual quality performance. Even relative newcomer ████ █████████ delivers, playing a friendly innocent with wit and subtlety.<br /><br />On a side note, █████████ is simply a "must see" if you're a █████ ███ ████████ fan. It appears ███████ ██████████ was influenced by earlier ████████ projects like One False Move and Sling Blade (though █████████ is certainly a lot more tongue-in-cheek than either). And ████████'s role as a character who is both sophisticated and down-to-earth is a perfect match for the actor.
