██████ ███████ is wonderful as the "philandering" dentist Dr. ██████ ███████ whose frequent fibs to girlfriend ██████ provide textbook proof of the dangers of lying. ██████ Hawn's touching kook ████ ███████ certainly deserved to win her Oscar. Ingrid ███████'s work as the stiff-as-starch nurse █████████ is also touching to watch as she comes out of her shell, slowly and nervously. This is a great movie to watch in the springtime, or any time for that matter. It's very underrated; I never heard about it until I found it in the video store, and what a find!
