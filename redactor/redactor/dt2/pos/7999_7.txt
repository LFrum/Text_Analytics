██████ ███████ is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films. Its predecessor, ██████, in my opinion, is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre. For one to say that ██████ ███████ was disappointing, he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of █████ ██████ as the Penguin. Devito and ██████ offer some memorable moments. The tale of ██████ is suppose to be dark and ███ ██████ has fulfilled how the comic portrays ██████. ██████ ███████ provides comic relief, action, suspense and fantasy; and it should not be viewed as 'crap', although we are all entitled to our own opinions.
