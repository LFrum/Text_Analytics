"Four Daughters" introduced ████ ████████ to audiences, and that is what is remembered most about this film today. Unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen image gels, ████████ established his immediately, with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talk of the fates being against him.<br /><br />It's actually the story of four girls, their widowed musician father (██████ █████) and their various suitors, one of whom, █████, is played by handsome ███████ ████. He's the one they all have a crush on, but he's in love with ████ (█████████ ████). Then she meets ne'er-do-well ██████ ██████, who falls for her as well. When ████ realizes that one of her sisters is in love with █████, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey.<br /><br />This is a fairly formulaic story given life (and sequels) by the acting. ████████ has already been mentioned, but █████████ ████ was by far the strongest of the daughters, the most interesting, and the best actress. ███████ ████ was a fresh and good-looking leading man, and this film got him off on the right foot with Warners. However, true stardom was not to be. Like many others of the era, he went into the service, and when he came out, he had a Bronze Star but not much of a career. He later went into television and real estate. ██████ █████ is warm and wonderful as the patriarch.<br /><br />So popular was "Four Daughters" that it inspired "Four Wives" and "Four Mothers," as well as reuniting much of the cast again in "Daughters Courageous" where the actors played different characters.<br /><br />Very enjoyable, a nice remembrance of simpler and probably happier times, and a chance to see ████ ████████ in his first film.
