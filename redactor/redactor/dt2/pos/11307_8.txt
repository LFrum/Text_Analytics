After all these years, I am puzzled as to why █████ █████ (West Coast) isn't a household name or a hugely famous comedic star. She is one of the funniest females on the planet. In this spoof, she takes on ███████ who is one of her favorite targets. She is ██████, a hugely successful singer, like ███████ who also happened to have documentary "Truth or ████." █████ █████ spoofs ███████ as ██████ who came from Wisconsin, the land of dairy and beer. I remember the segment where she went to Wisconsin to visit her family and a grave. I don't remember if it was a parent or her pet. I remember somebody saying that ██████ did nothing original. She was just copying others. I have to say that I hope this spoof documentary is available on DVD somewhere. █████ █████ was at her best mocking and spoofing others.
