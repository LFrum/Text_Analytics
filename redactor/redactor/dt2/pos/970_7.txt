SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />We've all heard the "Boy Who Cried ████" legend. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old █████ ███████ ( ███████ █████ from "Malcolm in the Middle" ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. One day he is pressured to write an English essay, but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker █████ ████ ( ████ ████████ ) who plans to turn █████'s story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes █████ when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school. However █████ is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to L.A. with his friend Kaylee ( Amanda Bynes ). When ████ refuses to admit he ripped off his story, █████ plans to make ████'s life a living hell. B.F.L. is no masterpiece but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you're time. I wished they could've made it a bit longer though and there aren't that much pranks although they are clever enough ( I like the pool-dye the best ). I might not have liked this as much as I do if it weren't for ████ ████████. He is simply hilarious in this. If you have 90 minutes to kill try this out. You might just enjoy it.
