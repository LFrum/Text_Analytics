I love █████ ██████'s Fingersmith, and was worried about the TV adaptation as I'd been disappointed by the BBC's version of Tipping the Velvet (which although beautiful to look at was let down by ██████ █████ not being able to sing, and ███████ ████████ not being able to act). Fingersmith is a very tightly plotted novel with breath taking twists and turns and I wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours.<br /><br />I needn't have worried. The adaptation was excellent, very little cut out, and went along at a cracking pace (although I did wonder whether if you hadn't read the book, would you miss things?). It had the look and feel of a BBC classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary book.<br /><br />The acting was stellar. Sally Hawkins acting her heart out as ███ ███████, and ██████ ███████, a slow burner, who by the end of the story was incandescent as ████ ██████. The love, the passion, the realisation of the acts of betrayal both would have to perform, were written on their faces. It was a joy to watch.<br /><br />I hope ███████ ████████ was watching: that's how you play a █████ ██████ character!
