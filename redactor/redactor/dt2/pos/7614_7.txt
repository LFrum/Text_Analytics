Never ████ Kissed gives ████ █████████ the chance to do something that maybe 70% of us would like to do. Go back to high school and make some necessary corrections. Actually the first time for me was bad enough and at my age I doubt I could pull it off the way ████ does.<br /><br />Of course the reason could also be that once we leave high school it's like leaving a cocoon and we have to deal with the great big unfriendly world out there. I've known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could. In fact there is a Law and █████ episode which explores the dark side of this same situation. A girl looking young enough to pull it off, goes through high school at least three times and kills the person who stumbles on her secret.<br /><br />With ████ though it's an assignment. She's a copy editor for the Chicago Sun Times who yearns to be a reporter. █████████ █████ ████████ who plays the part like ██████ █████ took over the Sun Times gets this brilliant idea and just sees in Barrymore a young enough looking person to pull off the masquerade. <br /><br />High School the first time was bad enough. ████ was not the most popular then and she's not doing better the second time around. That is until brother █████ ████████ also goes back to school and helps her over the rough patches.<br /><br />Of course this raises a whole lot of issues for ████, peer pressure from two sources, job and school. What's a girl to do?<br /><br />Never ████ Kissed is a light and charming comedy which to its credit skips over the opportunity to be crassly exploitive and gives us some good entertainment. ████ is very funny and sweet and her performance in moments of stress for her character moves nicely into pathos. ███████ Vartan as her English teacher is the kind I wish there were more of in the education field and ██████ ████████ and ███████ ████ play a pair of the empty headed cool kids that ████ tries so desperately to hook up with.<br /><br />Still it doesn't inspire me to return to ███████ ████ ██████.
