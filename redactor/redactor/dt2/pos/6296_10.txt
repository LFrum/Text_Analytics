██████ Phillips stars in the 1950s action adventure series - ███████ ████. Set in the fourteenth century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland, ███████ ████ is a reluctant freedom fighter, battling heroically against the tyranny and oppression of the invading forces. ███████ tell is the Swiss version of █████ ████. ██████ Phillips plays the protagonist fantastically. It is possible that ██████ ███████ would have had greater success in the role, but he was unavailable at the time of filming. The classic action show is made up of series of 39. The episodes are in black and white, but this does not detract from the entertainment in any way.
