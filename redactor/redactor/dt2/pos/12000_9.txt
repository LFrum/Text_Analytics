█████ to repeat myself over and over, but here's another great ███████ episode. I guess that's why I'm such a fan - most episodes really are great! The best episodes always have a standout feature of some sort, and in this case the murderer and his accomplice are possibly the youngest ever ███████ villains.<br /><br />After watching a lot of episodes where ███████ and his adversary act like close friends, it's good to see an episode where tempers fray and bad feelings rise to the surface. It just gives an episode a bit more drama and bite. ███████ is rapidly onto the fact that the two students who claim to be helping him are not very secretly laughing at him and feeding him false clues. He happily plays along, deliberately turning up the bumbling in front of them to make them underestimate him! But of course he knows instantly when they are talking baloney.<br /><br />The murder itself is another complicated one, along the lines of The Bye Bye Sky High IQ episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the assassins with a seemingly watertight alibi. In the intervening years between 1978 and 1990, the technology has moved on from record players and firecrackers to remote control car locking systems and hidden cameras.<br /><br />███████ ███████ puts in a great performance as ██████ ████, the obnoxious, spoilt student. ████ Hershberger is low-key but good as his "yes-man" friend ██████ ██████. And it's nice to see ██████ ████ as Mr Rowe, ██████'s dad.<br /><br />A very satisfying episode in all ways.
