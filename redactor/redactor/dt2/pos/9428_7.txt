For the sake of propaganda during World War II, ████████ ██████ was moved into the then-present. One of the results is "████████ ██████ and the Secret Weapon," starring a top ██████, █████ ████████, along with █████ █████, ██████ ██████, ██████ ████ and ██████ █████. It is ██████' assignment to deliver a scientist, Dr. █████ █████ (███████ ████ Jr.) and his weapon design to the British government before the Germans can get him. Once the man reaches England, however, his troubles are just beginning. Can ██████ decode the message Dr. █████ left before falling into the hands of the vicious Moriarity, save the weapon and possibly the scientist too? This is an effective ██████ story, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and blackout England. The series worked just fine in the present day. It was not without its problems, but those problems had nothing to do with the time period. Whose idea was it to make ██████ an idiot? █████ █████'s characterization - aided and abetted by the scripts - has always been the false note. I much prefer the characterization of ██████ █████████ in the Jeremy Brett ████████ ██████ series - there, he's attractive, intelligent and a believable companion for ██████. In the ████████ series, ██████ is often condescending and treats ██████ like the bumbling fool that he is. However, in this particular film, ██████ has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts.<br /><br />I admit to being a complete sap for ████████'s recitation from ███████ ██ - "...this blessed plot, this earth, this England" - I can't imagine how much it meant to the Brits watching the film in 1942. ████████ ██████ really served his purpose.
