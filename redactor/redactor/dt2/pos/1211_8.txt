In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. ████ █████ would take on █████ █████, or █████ ██████'s cronies or Ted DiBiase and come out victorious more often than not. Occasionally he would get an ally like █████ ██████ in 1988, but mostly it was all about ████ █████ vs █████ ██████, and that's the way it should be.<br /><br />But on this night that was about to change, a new champion, a man who the WWE thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. It didn't work out. But the WWE was right about one thing: ██████████ was finished and a new order needed to be established.<br /><br />This historic Wrestlemania, the first to be held outside America, kicked off with ████ ██████ defeating ████ █ ████. Koko never really had a lot of luck at Wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here.<br /><br />Next up the Colossal Connection Andre the Giant and ████ put their tag team titles on the line against Demolition Ax and █████ and lost. New tag team champions crowned.<br /><br />Next match saw ██████████ defeat ████████. ████████ was another fellow who didn't really have a lot of luck at Wrestlemania. Plenty of luck for ██████ ████████ as he ended Mr ███████'s undefeated streak. Well, I guess someone had to end it.<br /><br />█████ █████ and Bad News Brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match, next up the Hart Foundation defeated ███████ ██████ and █████ ██████ in 19 seconds. Not really a match, unfortunately. The Barbarian then defeated ████ ███████ in a short match.<br /><br />The American Dream Dusty Rhodes and ███████ then defeated the Macho King █████ ██████ and █████ ██████ in a messy mixed tag match. This was the only female wrestling really going on in the WWE at this point of time.<br /><br />Next up was a fun match as the Rockers Marty Janetty and █████ ████████ defeated The Orient Express in a fast paced encounter. There were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time. ███ ██████ then beat ████ █████ in a nothing match.<br /><br />Next Ted DiBiase put his most cherished possession, the Million Dollar Championship on the line against ████ ███████. ███████ was distracted by ██████ and counted out allowing Ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show.<br /><br />Next up the Twin Towers collide as the Big Bossman defeats █████ in short order, this is followed by ████ ████ winning a short match with █████ Snuka.<br /><br />Finally we come to the main event with ████ █████ putting the WWE Title on the line against Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior. This is an entertaining back and forth match won by the Warrior after █████ missed a leg drop. The crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle.<br /><br />And so the torch was passed, but would the Ultimate Warrior prove to be the Champion the WWE hoped he would be?
