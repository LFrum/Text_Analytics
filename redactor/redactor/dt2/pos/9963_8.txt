Venice, in 1596.Jews are separated from the good Christians.Bassanio, a young but poor Venetian loves the fair Portia, who is a wealthy heiress.So he approaches his friend, a merchant called ███████ for three thousand ducats to travel to Belmont and propose Portia.All of ███████'s ships and merchandise are busy at sea, so he turns to the moneylender ███████, the one of Jewish faith.███████ does not like ███████, for he spat on his face.He offers ███████ a three-month loan at no interest, but if he will not pay the money in that time, he will own a pound of his flesh.Also, ███████'s daughter ███████ elopes with the Christian ███████.The Merchant of Venice is based on ███████ ███████████'s play that's believed to have written between 1596 and 1598.I read the play last summer and now I've seen the movie, made in 2004 by ███████ █████████ liked the play, and I don't quite agree with the accusations of it being anti-Semitic.The Jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster, even though he's ready to cut a piece of ███████'s flesh.There's a lot of depth in his character, which all comes out in his speech where he asks "If you prick us, do we not bleed?" and so forth.There is much more human in ███████'s character than in one of ███████'s, who spits on the good Jew.Al Pacino is unbeatable as ███████.He gives such a strong performance.Jeremy █████ is also terrific as ███████.Lynn Collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia.Zuleikha ████████ does great job as ███████, and ███████ ███ as ███████ is also very good.Kris Marshall plays Gratiano, and he does a good job.In the role of Nerissa we see Heather Goldenhersh.Mackenzie Crook plays █████████ Gobbo.As in Shakespeare plays usually, also this one contains most brilliant dialogue.The movie paints a fantastic portray of the era.It deals with some great issues, in a Shakespearian way.
