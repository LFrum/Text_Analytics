Its success owed more to the success of "Roots" a similar Civil War era/slavery soap opera televised about a decade earlier in the 70's. ███████ ██████, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was doing many films like █████ ███████ which would make him famous, stars as ████ ████, a plantation-born young man from South Carolina who sets off to West Point. Here he meets ██████ ██████ (█████ ████) who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the Yankee North, but with whom he bonds closely. Soon, the Mains from the South and the Hazards from the North become friends despite the turbulent era leading to civil war. The theme of family, friendship and doing the right thing even when the nation was falling apart is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of action and romance. Clariss and ██████ (████ ███████ and ████ ██████) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (████ █████████. Garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil ██████ is fun to watch on screen. Though the series didn't cover everything in Jakes' novels, what we see is a condensed version of it and they changed a few things to make it a sort of historical romance with history lessons attached. The characters find themselves in all the major Civil War scenes - ██████'s █████ where abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (███████ █████) loses the love of her life, the ex-slave █████, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, ████████, Gettysburg, █████████ and we are privy to the White House where we see ███████ ███████ (Hal Halbrook) battle out the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players including ███, █████, ███████, ███████ and █████. Several veteran Hollywood actors from the Golden Era - ██████ ███████, █████████ ██████ and ██████ ██ █████████ have cameos and it's interesting to see them. This is not historical fact, it's historical FICTION and purely dramatized entertainment. But it's got cliffhanger endings and beautiful cinematography, costumes and locations. It is like watching an epic movie that runs longer than Gone With The Wind with with war scenes in it! The script may be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. Swayze hams it up as does █████ ██████ but some performances, like that of ███████ █████, █████ ████ (as ██████ ██████)and ██████ ████ ██████ as the beautiful and strong Madeline are really good performances. They shot in sets and in Southern locations.The music is enchanting and this is a feel good film in which we root for the good guys and watch the villains scheme and ultimately get their comeuppance. All fans of Civil War movies and the Jakes novels should watch this. It's available on DVD and VHS.
