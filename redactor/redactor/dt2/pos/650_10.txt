A wonderful film ahead of its time,<br /><br />I think so, In the eighty's it was all about winning, Greed is ████ ? Remember that one ? I have seen this film more that 20 times, To me this is a real desert island film, I keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that I just love, ███████ █████, and ████ ██████, are simply wonderful,Also ███████ ████████, ████ ███████ come in at a close second, don't get me wrong there are many more great performance's in this film, and it is also the way it is written that made it for me, and I hope you, a film that you will want to see over and over, I think TV shows like "███████ ████████", and now "Earl" owe a lot to this film. but remember it is not a Tom Cruise film.
