█████ Ups has been compared to ███████ for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching ███████. ███████ has a beginning that builds builds builds. When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his ███████, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now torn down) and notices the Charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular. From that moment on, when McQueen starts that car, begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. Adding to it is a terrific ████ █████████ If I remember correctly sound track. This goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. That shot of McQueen's ███████ suddenly appearing in ████ ███████'s rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. ███████'s look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. Then of course, ███ █████████ is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. Also, ███████ being filmed in the 60s when cars were still "Hot" (███████ ██ and █████ ███████) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden ████████ in the 1970s █████ Ups. ████ ███████ was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. I saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I was doing movie reviews for a paper. They gave it a good try in █████ Ups though with the chase scene. █████ ups had a few "jumps" over little hills, (Yawn) but of course they were not ███ █████████ hills. The █████ Ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in ███████. But the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity. Strictly █████████, I would say, except that it was filmed in New York.
