Having just got the "█████ █████ ██████ Collection"(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.<br /><br />██████ █████████ is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being "██████ ████" and "Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and █████ argue about who █████ ████ should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! On the DVD it has a commentary, featurette, & option to play it music only.<br /><br />My Grade: A+<br /><br />DVD Extras: Disk 1: an introduction by █████ █████; The Boy of Termite Terrice part 1; clips from the films "Two Guys from Texas" and "My Dream is Yours", both with ████ cameos; Bridging sequences for an episode of "the ████ █████ show"; the Astro Nuts audio recording session; 2 vintage trailers; "Blooper █████: ████ █████ 51st and a half anniversary" with optional commentary with writer ████ ████ & stills gallery
