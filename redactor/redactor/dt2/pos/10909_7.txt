I remember seeing this a long while ago, and I knew most of the concept, but no detail, so I'm glad I watched it again, from director █████ ██ (The Muppets Take Manhattan, █████████). Basically new star ███████ █████ (████ ██████) has just won the Academy Award for his latest, where he plays a gay soldier, and he does the usual "thank yous", he even mentions his past school ███████ teacher ██████ ████████ (Golden Globe nominated █████ █████), and he outs him as gay! ██████ is determined to clear his name, and get out of the media spotlight as a denying gay man, especially as his marriage to Emily Montgomery (█████ and Golden Globe nominated ████ ██████) is on the way. So it comes to the wedding day, and when it comes to ██████ saying yes or no, that is when he outs himself, and admits to himself and everyone, that he is gay. This of course gets him fired as a teacher, but everyone stands at the graduation day to out themselves (in support), and ███████ even shows up to clear things up, so that everyone, especially school head ███ █████████ (Elf's ███ ███████) knows it's okay to be gay. Also starring ███ ███████ as █████ ██████, ██████ ████████ as ████████ ████████, ███████ ███████ as █████ ████████, ███████ █████ as ██████ ████████, █████ █████, ██████ ████████ and ███ ████. The highlight of the film has to be when █████ can't help dancing to █████ ████'s version of "I Will Survive", that must have been what convinced him of his sexuality. █████ is always good, Cusack is a surprise █████ nominee, and all supporting cast members do their bit too in this very funny comedy. Very good!
