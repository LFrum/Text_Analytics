This is a whodunnit in the Hitchcock tradition. You are kept in the dark as suspects come and go. ██████ Quaid is supurb as ██████, a man doomed to die and ███ ████ excellent as his babe. There is not much not to like in this little suspense and all the pieces fit neatly together the way they should. You won't be sorry you watched this one if you like suspense.
