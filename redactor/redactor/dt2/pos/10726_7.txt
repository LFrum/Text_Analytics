I remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister. I was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the drive closed down 4 years later, but the film still lingers in my memory. An adult movie, which a kid finds entertaining. That is a mark of excellence. ███████ is one of hollywoods better actors, and this film proves it. I like the █████ put down the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version in there film I factory myself. Remember ███ ███████ crying. Please email me if you like the SCTV skit. Not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son. Touching and intertaining, I love the part where ███████ talks about ███████, and how the streets change. Worth a second watch. 7/10
