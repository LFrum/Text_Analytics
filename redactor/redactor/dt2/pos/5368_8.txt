A young couple -- father Ben (solid ███████ ███████), wife Nicky (the lovely ████ █████) and their daughter KT (the cute ████ ███████ of "I Dismember Mama" fame) -- find themselves trapped in a small California desert town populated by hysterical lunatics. Worse yet, there's a pernicious Satanic cult that's been abducting little children for their own diabolical purposes. Director ███████ ████████, working from an offbeat and inspired script by ███████ █████ and L.Q. █████ ("█████ █████ Five" director ████ █████████ came up with the bizarre story), relates the compellingly oddball plot at a slow, yet steady pace and ably creates a creepy, edgy, mysterious ooga-booga atmosphere. ████████ ██████ delivers a wonderfully wicked and robust performance as ███ ██████, who's the gleefully sinister leader of the evil sect. The top-rate cast of excellent character actors qualifies as a substantial asset: █████ as gruff, no-nonsense Sheriff Hillsboro, ████ █████ as friendly local Toby, and ███████ ████████ as a shrewd, fiercely devout priest ████. ████ ██████ ███████'s bright, polished widescreen cinematography, █████ ████████████'s spooky score, and the wild, rousing climactic black mass ritual are all likewise up to speed. The idea of having toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy tank coming real and crushing a family in their car is truly jolting). Nice eerily ambiguous ending, too. A pleasingly idiosyncratic and under-appreciated winner.
