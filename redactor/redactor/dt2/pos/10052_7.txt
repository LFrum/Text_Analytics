Dashing █████ █████ brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of ██████ █████████ ██████. The dashing, jovial █████ essays ██████ from his days at West Point as a reckless, headstrong cadet, through the Civil War years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally as the nonpareil Indian fighter whose blunder at the Little Big Horn is excused as a sacrifice by ██████ of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, █████'s co-star in several other films, scores as the devoted, adoring █████ █████, and ███████ █████ looks the part as the fierce Sioux chief █████ █████. The film's battle scenes are excellent. The Civil War battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which ██████, seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers, hammers the Confederate army into submission. ██████'s last fight against the Indians is a grand spectacle, a savage clash between red men and white, with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men. Great direction, cinematography, casting and wonderful music by ███ ███████ make this film a Hollywood classic.
