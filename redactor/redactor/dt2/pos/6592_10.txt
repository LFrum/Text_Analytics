This is an outstanding criminal thriller, and with a great cast too. Spanish language cinema's best and most popular actors of the past couple of decades, ████████ █████ and ████████ Luppi, team up in one of the better Spanish language crime thrillers of 2004-5.<br /><br />The film begins by focusing on thirty something ███████ (███████ Alterio), an elegant, attractive and slick thief who learned from childhood friend ██████, and more recently from █████, an old seasoned swindler. █████ introduces ███████ to ████████ (████████ Luppi), an also elegant, but more astute & experienced methodical thief - the best in his class.<br /><br />████████'s only known weakness is Pilar (████████ █████), his former mistress and partner. She suddenly appears and proposes a fabulous rip-off scheme to her former lover, a crime in grand scale, which will eventually require the help of ███████, █████ and ██████, among others.<br /><br />The script is full of twists and surprising reversals, particularly towards the end of the film. One criticism about the film I've heard a lot is that there are too many plot twists towards the end, but I disagree. The film captivates the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow. In fact, these are what make the film outstanding. I highly recommend it.
