Possibly the finest moment of TV, at least in my memory, as millions could watch ███████████'s gripping Kings cycle (███████ ██ - ███████ ███) play out on prime time TV (I believe it was on Friday nights). No word was left out, and the plays awoke in me (who was then in elementary school) a thirst for history and a hunger for ███████████ and drama.<br /><br />Let's see these reissued on DVD. What a set this would be!
