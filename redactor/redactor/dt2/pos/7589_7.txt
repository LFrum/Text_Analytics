Every Sunday is an eleven minute short subject featuring the talents of two of its young juvenile contract players, a pair who would develop into players of note in the future. It's interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of ████ ███████ and ██████ ██████ as they perform at a Sunday concert for ██████'s uncle.<br /><br />Of course no one knew how big both of these young ladies would get to be. I've always wondered why █████ kept Garland and let ██████ go to Universal. L.B. always had pretensions to culture and this was the guy who had ████████ █████████ at his studio and later on hired such lovely soprano voices as ████ ██████, ███ █████, ███████ ██████, etc.<br /><br />Judy certainly had her glorious career at MGM, but she paid a heavy price for it. ██████, along with ██████&████████ and several Gothic horror monsters preserved Universal pictures. She was smart enough to get out at the top and make it stick.<br /><br />So, in their salad days, ██████ ██████ and ████ ███████.
