Well, I've just seen ██████ ██████'s film debut in █████ ████████'s The Butcher Boy and-despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason-I found plenty to laugh at. Like when ██████ orders molasses from butcher boy █████, █████ makes ██████ come back to pay, ██████ says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses, █████ dumps molasses in ██████'s hat and takes money, ██████ takes hat back on head as it gets stuck, █████ attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor, ██████'s feet are now stuck on floor and so on. That probably didn't read funny but on screen it was hilarious as were some more slapstick involving flour being thrown and a later sequence that takes place in █████'s girlfriend's boarding school with █████ dressed in drag and ██████ helping █████'s rival also in drag. Like I said, many scenes don't make a lick of sense but the visuals, especially those involving ████████ and Keaton, are laugh inducing even today. Recommended viewing for Keaton completists.
