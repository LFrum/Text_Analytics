'The ███████' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. Written by ██████ ███████ (himself a former dresser to the legendary ██████ ██████), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.<br /><br />As 'Sir', the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, ██████ ██████ is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow, winds ...' bit of 'King ████' or chatting to his faithful stage manager, Madge (██████ ██████, good as ever) about the old times. As Norman, his camp dresser, ███ █████████ gives a fabulous performance, wiggling around at the beck and call of '████', collecting a bottle to go at the pub, or bitchily disparaging the former ████, Mr Davenport-Scott (often mentioned, but never seen!).<br /><br />In an engaging support cast, there's ██████ ███ as Oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead), ████ ██████ as her Ladyship, ████████ ████ as the replacement ████, and many others.<br /><br />This film has great energy, bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins, it is true, but being so well-acted you don't notice. Very well done indeed.
