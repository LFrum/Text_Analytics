I thought this was a great action flick. A very good role for █████ █████. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favs next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched The Long Kiss Goodnight right after seeing the new ████ ██████ movie. It got me thinking, ███████ or ████? Which one would win in a fight??? Either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they're kicking butt. I just hope to see █████ in another film soon. Seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long. It would be especially nice to see her in another film with ██████ ██ ███████. Now they make a great duo. Watch this film if you haven't. You won't be disappointed.
