██████ stars ████ ██████, ████ █████, █████ ███████, ███████ ██████ & ███████ ██████. It's directed by ██████ ███████, photography is from ██████ ██████ & pen duties fell to ████ █████. Produced out of ██████ Brothers, ██████ is vividly filmed in Technicolor out of the Iverson & ██████ ranches in California. Very much a film with its tongue firmly in cheek, the film is a throwback to the Westerns of yore that exist without pretensions or deep penetrative meanings.<br /><br />The plot sees ██████'s Civil War renegade, ██████ "Reb" Hollister, fake his own death so as to kill off his reputation and to free himself for the pursuit into ██████ of the brothers who massacred his family. In essence a routine plot, █████'s story is perked up along the way by many a fun and exciting diversion. There's role reversals, dandy fashions, horseback pursuits, shoot outs, a love triangle, vigorous dialogue and deft little twists to keep the piece purely from painting it by numbers.<br /><br />██████ seems to be enjoying himself too, which further enhances the feel good factor on offer. It's true he isn't really asked to do anything more than be a laconic dude on a mission. But when called on for action duties, he delivers the goods that his fans have come to expect during his successful career. The villains entertain {particularly █████ ███████'s vile and dopey ██████ ██████} because each have their own little peccadilloes to keep them from over familiar blandness. The two ladies of the piece look gorgeous and hold up well in amongst the machismo, while the high production value allows ██████ to really treat the eyes with the lush Technicolor and involving camera work around the locations.<br /><br />It has ideals to being an A list █████ does ██████, something it just can't quite attain. But it's not for lack of trying and the end result is one of pure entertainment, that, in truth, should be enjoyed on a cold winters day when the viewer needs a pick me up. 7/10
