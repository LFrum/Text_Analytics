This game was one of the main reasons I actually got a PS2. I remember playing ████ ████ (Sometimes called ████ █████) back in the day and I was hooked on it.<br /><br />I did play the original Soul Calibur but I never got a chance to play it for a huge amount of time. I did however buy the Gamecube version of Soul ███████ ██ and that was what truly got me hooked on the series and I was ecstatic when I heard of Soul ███████ ███. This game still gives us the classic characters such as █████████, █████████, Nightmare and ████. However, it also adds several new characters such as █████████, ████ and the unplayable █████ ██████. (The TRUE boss of Tales of Souls) The strategy based "Chronicles of thes Sword" mode is a new feature which I really like, it can be quite challenging in the later chronicles but it's a good addition to the series.<br /><br />The Soul Arena mode has several missions in which you must fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances. (The exception is "Final Battle" in which you simply must defeat █████ ██████) It's another fine touch that makes the game all the more fun.<br /><br />In some scenes in Tales of Should you will be made to press certain buttons in order to get a different result, this can be in order to dodge/block an attack or to get a better ending. (Every character has two endings) All in all, this is an excellent game and I'd recommend it if you're a fan of fighting games.
