Affable aspiring cartoonist █████ ██████ (a wonderfully engaging performance by ████ ██████) and his best buddy ██████ (the deliciously deadpan ████ ██████) go to Nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. Hoops, ██████, and several newfound pals come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming), a singer who's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer/director Savage █████ ███████ offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb, but still very funny jokes. The constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist. Moreover, the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: ██████ ██████████ as the spastic Egg Stork, ███ ███████ as his goofy brother ████, ██████ █████████ as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, ████ ███████ as evil rich jerk ███████ ██████████, ████ ███████ as the mean █████, ████████ ██████ as the fetching ██████, ███ ████████ as the gung-ho General Raymond, ███████ ██████ as cranky ███ ███ ██████████, ██████ █████ as smug preppy bully Ty, and ████ ████████ as hulking biker Stan. ███████ █████████'s slick cinematography, the hip thrashy soundtrack, ████ ██████' cool rockin' score, and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. Single funniest scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. An absolute hoot.
