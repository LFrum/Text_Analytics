While the camerawork was certainly "funky" - perhaps one dutch-roll short of "stoned" - the premise of the film was fantastic. It really took a scathingly satirical (in the true traditional of ███ ███████) look at God, █████ and █████. The interaction of █████ and Satan provides some hilarious scenes... Even the monologues of █████ were great - this was by far the best █████ I've even seen. So laidback, Zen-like, Son-of-God-ish but still such a nice guy. On one level this is a very general look on the paradoxes of Christianity, but yet there is still a personal level, where you can relate to █████ ██████ without having a God-Complex (thanx to ██████ ███████ and ███ ███████).
