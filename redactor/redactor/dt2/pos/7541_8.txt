Choose your fate: The terrible tykes of the fourth form, playing practical jokes that involve axes, or the...ummm...well-developed girls of the sixth form, who discovered some time ago cigarettes, gin, sex and how easily men can be led astray. The problem is that one set comes with the other. They are all there at ███ ███████'s, that remarkably easy-going English school for girls led by headmistress █████████ ███████ (████████ ███). As ████ ███████ is fond of pointing out, "In other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared." ████ ███████ sounds something like a melding of █████ █████ and ███████ █████████, and definitely has ███'s droll and deadpan comic genes. <br /><br />In The Belles of ███ ███████'s, a sly, chaotic comedy from the team of █████ ███████ and ██████ ███████, ███ ███████'s is, as usual, on the brink of financial disaster. Salvation may be at hand, however, when a rich sheik sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a proper English education. The sheik also is a horse owner and one of his prize racers, ████ ███, is being trained near the school for a race. It's only a matter of time before the fourth- form girls form a racing pool and bet heavily on ████ ███, with ████ ███████ adding to the pool what funds the school has left. (Much of the fourth-form girl's money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and lower by rope to █████ █████ (██████ ████), a Cockney fixer, for distribution. "It's got something...I don't know quite what," says ████ ███████ on sampling the stuff, "but send a few bottles up to my room.") <br /><br />████ ███████, however, has a brother, ████████ ███████ (who, by some coincidence of casting, also is ████████ ███), a bookmaker who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. And he has placed the precocious ████████ in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form has kidnapped ████ ███, the fourth form has taken the horse back, █████ █████ has joined forces with ████ ███████, the sixth-form girls are determined that ████ ███ will not leave the second floor of ███ ███████'s, Clarence and his Homburg-wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for Parent's Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. Total war breaks out at ███ ███████'s. It's hard to say which is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /><br />████████ ███ as █████████ ███████ turns in a tour de force performance. ████ ███████ is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in stride, even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. "Oh dear. I told ██████ to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!" She is firm in believing that ███ ███████'s is "a gay arcadia of happy girls." ███ was one of Britain's great eccentric actors. Other than the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so little) girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the film's pleasure.
