A brilliant and sensitive movie with interwoven plot lines. As a general warning, the movie turns quite dark about half way through. As sudden as it is, this is a change that I found fitting to the themes of the movie, particularly the comparison of the Ishkanani to the filthy rich, and (as is said by ████ at the end) how each person makes up the tribe, and how the whole tribe is reflected in each person.<br /><br />█████ ███████ (████ Earl) is spectacular in this movie. He is probably best known as ██████ from ████ ████ or Kyle Reese in Terminator Salvation, but he's been in a whole plethora of movies you've probably never heard of (█████ ███, which is another brilliant performance on ███████'s part, House of D, Hearts in Atlantis, to name a few...) The point is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own. Other excellent performances from █████ ████ and ██████ ██████████ are what takes this movie up a notch, from great to excellent.
