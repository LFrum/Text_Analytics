10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:<br /><br />███████ ████ (dir)--████████ █████ (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (█████ wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.<br /><br />███████ █████████--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.<br /><br />Jean-Luc Godard--████ ████████ █████. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing. Filled with gratuitous female nudity. The worst!<br /><br />Julien Temple--Verdi. ████ Henry, ███████ ████████ and █████ ██████ star in this funny, if obvious, story about a cheating couple. Pretty good.<br /><br />█████ █████████--█████ ████████. Short, lush and romantic. Very good.<br /><br />██████ ██████--Jean-Philippe Rameau. Dull. A yawner.<br /><br />████ ██████--███████ ██████. This has ███████ █████ in her film debut. Beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene. <br /><br />███ ███████--███████ ███████. Really strange but OK.<br /><br />█████ ██████--███████ ██████████. Lyrical look at youth and old age. Very sweet. <br /><br />The last is by ████ ██████ doing "I Pagliacci". He has ████ ████ (!) dressed as a clown lip-syncing to Caruso (!!!).<br /><br />When this came out it almost got an X rating (for the abundant nudity and the sex scene). It was given an R with a strict warning attached saying the R rating would be heavily enforced. After the film bombed that warning disappeared.<br /><br />The idea isn't bad and 6 out of the 10 segments were worthwhile. Worth seeing even if you don't like opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I'm giving it an 8.
