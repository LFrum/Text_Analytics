Here's a well-made war story, nicely shot and well-acted. The portraying of the Italian and German occupancy of Greek island Kefalonia is well-done. ████ Hurt as ███████'s father and the island doctor is superb, ███████ ████ does a good job as the Captain from the title, ████████ ████ does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at Cage. There's heroics and humor, there's drama and romance, and it is all set on an idyllic island.<br /><br />Oddly enough, a very similar, or should I say almost identical, storyline, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel by the same title, written by █████ de █████████. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful ███████, daughter of doctor ██████, and their life on Kefalonia during WWII. ███████'s fiancee, local fisherman ███████, enlists when the Italian Army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretenses. When the Axis finally prevails, with a lot of help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and ███████ ███████ plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time. As ███████ joins the partisans, charming ███████ and his mandolin are quartered with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes it a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a tale of Communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of the madness of Mussolini, and, most importantly, an ode to island life on Kefalonia.<br /><br />Some of these elements return in the movie, but in general, it is an impossible book to film. I am glad nobody ever tried.<br /><br />The movie '███████ ███████'s ████████', however, is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book *after* you see the movie.
