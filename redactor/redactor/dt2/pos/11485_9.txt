Don't hate ███████ ██████ because she's beautiful, hate her because she's fun to watch in this movie. Like the hip clothing and funky surroundings, the actors in this flick work well together. █████ Affleck is hysterical and ███████ ██████ literally lights up the screen. The minor characters - █████ ███████ {sigh} and ████████ █████████ are as TALENTED as they are gorgeous. Congratulations Miramax & ████████ ████ ███████!
