One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore, "Ten Cents a Dance" stars ███████ ████████ as the dance-hall girl "███████" in her sixth role. ████████ looks quite "plain-jane" in this one, and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager. Then along comes rich guy ███████ ███████ (███████ ██████) who wants to sweep her off her feet. (Cortez and ████████ had made three films together in the 1930s.) Then she meets █████, who's very different from the dashing ███████. The writer, ██ ████████, had worked on some biggies (Its a Wonderful Life, ████ and █████, and ████ with the Wind) so I was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary. The story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru, and is VERY similar to "The Bride Walks Out" from 1936, ALSO starring ████████.... T.B.W.O. is much more clever, but also more tame, due to on-slaught of the Hays code...
