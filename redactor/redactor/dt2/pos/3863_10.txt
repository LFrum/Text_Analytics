The 20th animated Disney classic is often criticized by many people as "mediocre" or poor in quality, but it is a great movie.<br /><br />Too bad that "The Aristocats" doesn't get the deserved credit. I personally see it as one of my favorite Disney classics.<br /><br />Despite being extremely underrated, it is one of the funniest Disney classics. It is full of hilarious (some of them, hysterical) moments.<br /><br />█████, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he is so funny.<br /><br />Every scene with █████ and the hound dogs ████████ and █████████ chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll ever see, especially the one when █████ drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge, with the dogs chasing him. That is hysterical!<br /><br />But the classic humor doesn't just come from █████ or the hound dogs. Other characters have their moments as well.<br /><br />About the quality subject, it isn't perfect, but remains on a high level. Even after ████ ██████'s death those artists knew how to keep faithful to ████'s spirit and "The Aristocats" is one of those examples. They don't make them like this nowadays!<br /><br />As usual, legendary Disney actors voice the characters. In this case, we have ████ ██████, ████████ ████████, ████ ████████, ███ █████ and ███ Buttram.<br /><br />The characters are cool in general: ██████ ████████, Duchess and her 3 kittens, the mouse █████████, the alley cats, the English geese, the hound dogs and the horse. The human characters are included as well: the eccentric and kind retired █████ singer ██████ ████████ ██████████, the comic ██████'s old lawyer ███████ ██████████ and █████ himself!<br /><br />About the soundtrack, it has some nice and catchy songs such as ██████ ████████'s theme (but I can't remember its name), "Everybody Wants to be a Cat" and "The Aristocats" (sung by ███████ █████████), for example.<br /><br />This movie takes place in Paris (France), in the year of 1910. Above all, this is a joyful, nice and very pleasant movie. A timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthy.<br /><br />This should definitely be on Top 250.
