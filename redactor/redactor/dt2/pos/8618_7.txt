█████████ █████████ is a French director who loves to provoke her audience. She takes us along to witness how a film is done on location. The movie in production seems to be based on herself, since the person at the center of the story is ██████, a woman director, much like Ms. Breillat. ██████ acts as the alter ego of the real director.<br /><br />██████ reaches an impasse at the start of filming. Not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell, as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras. ██████ has problems with the two principal actors, especially, the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie; the lead actress is no angel either.<br /><br />Movie making, Ms. Breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art. First, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, ██████, has written a screen play, that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer/director didn't think about. There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact. What appeared clever in the written page, doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera. The actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man.<br /><br />The luminous ████ █████████ is marvelous as ██████, the director. She makes observations about the production, the actors, and the crew that fit well into the story being told. Gregoire Colin and ██████ ████████ play the lead actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set. ██████ has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end. ██████ █████████ plays ███, ██████'s assistant.<br /><br />"Sex Is Comedy" allows Ms. Breillet to give us her own take on films in general. This is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical Breillat style.
