Even for the non-opera loving public the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by █████ about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. But as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by ███████ ███████ in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted Spanish director ███████ ██████ ('Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love','Amantes', 'If they tell you I fell', etc.). Incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of ██████ from one of her lovers - ████ - provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told. <br /><br />██████ (the amazingly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper ████ (████████ █████████) is stationed. ██████ is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that ██████ is a gypsy, ██████ murders the co-worker and is arrested. ████ is physically attracted to the voluptuous ██████ and when ██████ flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with ██████. ██████ keeps her pact, providing ████ with his first sexual encounter, and ████ is doomed. His lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but at his release ████ encounters ██████ again, kills a fellow officer, and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are ██████'s people. Many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but when ██████'s real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take over, behavior's that include ██████'s infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of ██████ and ████ comes to a tragic end. <br /><br />One factor that makes the story (as adapted for the screen by director ██████ and ███████ █████ move so well is the role that ███████ ███████ (███ ████████) plays: his questioning of ████ completes the story that █████'s opera only outlines. The acting is superb, the cinematography by ████ ███████ and the excellent musical score by ████ █████ contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film. This is a must for lovers of the opera ██████, and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces. Highly recommended. █████ Harp
