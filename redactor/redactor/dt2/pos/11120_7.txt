Film follows a bunch of students in the NYC High School of the Performing Arts. There's ████ (█████ ████) a black singer who WILL make it to the top despite everything. She's helped by Bruno (███ ██████) a white musician. Then there's Doris (███████ █████) who wants to be an actress--but she's shy and scared. She becomes friends with Motgomery (████ ███████)--purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by ████ (█████ ██████). Then there's █████ (Gene Anthony Ray--who sadly died in 2003) who's homeless and a great dancer--but can't read. Then there's various teachers (██████ █████, ████ █████ stand out) trying to teach the kids.<br /><br />The songs are GREAT (the title tune and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for ████ ████--"Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent. BUT this film misses the boat in the drama department. Many plot lines are brought up and completely left open-ended by the end of the movie. Why did ████ do a porno? ███ Doris and ████ remain together afterwords? ███ either make it? How about Montgomery--what happened to him? And did █████ ever graduate--and how? There are too many long speeches (████ has two) and moments that just lead to nothing. I'm assuming there were cuts in the script--I can't believe the movie just left all this open. <br /><br />Still, it's worth seeing for the acting and, again, the music. There's basically not one bad song and the dances go full force (and at one point stop traffic--literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here..." and "I Sing the Body Electric" which is a great closing song. So I recommend it but can only give it a 7--the script really needed to tie up loose ends--and it didn't.<br /><br />Trivia: They wanted to shot this film at the actual School for Performing Arts but couldn't get permission. The dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film. That is true--there is a LOT of foul language but that's how high school kids talk. Avoid the TV version which abysmally overdubs it.
