First off- What are some of you thinking? This is the best movie I've seen in ages! <br /><br />Secondly- I don't think of it as a British movie as it is set in Dublin and has mainly Irish actors- █████, Gambon, ███████ █ ████████(Rita), ███████ O'Kane etc.<br /><br />Thirdly- I thought that █████ was excellent. He was hilariously funny through out. ███████ █████ seemed only to be there to get █████ context. Each character he took on he perfected. <br /><br />███████ ███████ I thought was better than any other child actor I have seen. She was believable as the smart kid and also as a kid and an adult(yes I know that sounds strange but hey...). Even she managed to upstage █████. <br /><br />Iversen and █████ worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene.<br /><br />Barreler(Gambon) was very funny in his ineptitude.
