If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable ██████ █████ cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially █████ constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between █████ and ████, and that ████ wins every time. I also love it that █████ is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too. ████ is still his charming and rascally self, and █████ is funny if rather dumb too. In short, this is absolutely brilliant, and actually my personal favourite of the Hunting Trilogy for sheer entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
