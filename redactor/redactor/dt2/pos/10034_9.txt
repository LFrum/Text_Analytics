It's true that "They Died With █████ █████ On" gives a highly fictionalized account of ██████ █████████ ██████'s (Errol █████) life and career, but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the US-American cavalryman and Native American leader Chief █████ █████ (███████ █████) in a favorable light. I'm almost tempted to say that "Little Big Man" in its unqualified anti-██████ stance seems unbalanced by comparison. Further, one should not be mislead by the title of the picture  this isn't just a movie about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, it's a movie about that shows the unreliable West Point cadet, the famed █████ ███ hero, the Indian fighter, and, last but not least, the husband.<br /><br />The movie begins with ██████'s time at the West Point military academy, where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. During a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, █████████ █████ (██████ ██ █████████), who, like ██████ himself, is a native of ██████, ████████. ██████ intends to court her, but the outbreak of the █████ ███ calls him away. ██████'s legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary Southern cavalry general ███ ██████ during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on leave, he travels to ██████ and courts █████████, who promises him her hand in matrimony. Immediately after the war, ██████ and █████████ █████ are married.<br /><br />With the █████ ███ over, ██████ is demoted, doesn't get a real command, and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small, professional American army. As he starts to drink, his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general-in-chief Winfield Scott. ██████ is given the command of the US 7th Cavalry, which he trains to be an elite unit. Neither ██████ nor █████ █████ are desirous of battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through Indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties. ██████ explicitly acknowledges the justice of █████ █████'s cause, but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle.<br /><br />"They Died With █████ █████ On," though short on historical accuracy, is as good as war movies and Westerns in the 1940s got: Both ██████ and █████ █████ are played by major actors, neither the Indians nor the Southern Confederacy are denigrated, and the courtship scenes with beautiful █████ de Havilland are just charming. The only minus, and that's why I can't give this picture a full 10, is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of African American servants; █████████'s servant Callie is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mammy.<br /><br />It is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either ██████ or █████ █████, but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring Washington politicians with semi-criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the Native Americans. Just a couple of years later, the insinuation that American entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers.<br /><br />Needless to say that "They Died With █████ █████ On" omits the fact that ██████'s overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy, greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with ██████, and doesn't mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Nevertheless, ██████ was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the Battles of ██████ ███████, Gettysburg, █████████ ███████ and others, though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the █████ ███ as "They Died With █████ █████ On" suggests.<br /><br />In any event, "They Died With █████ █████ On" is a well-made war movie with Western elements, three outstanding performers (█████, █████, and de Havilland), and offers a positive view of Native Americans as well as a negative one on big money, which wouldn't be seen in major Hollywood productions for decades to come. It would deserve a 10 if it weren't for the racist minstrelization of African Americans.
