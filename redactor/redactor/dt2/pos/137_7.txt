Anything ████ Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum. Well, anything that isn't I'm a Cyborg at least. ████'s newest film titled ██████ is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes, that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by █████ ████ titled Therese Raquin. ████ creates a uniquely Korean, and uniquely ████, vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. ████ delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like ██████ or even that of ████ █████████. Heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience, ██████ desperately needed another trip through the cutting room. It crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely. As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of ████ Chan-wook film.<br /><br />Check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
