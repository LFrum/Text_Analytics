Near-wonderful mixture of comedy, romance, and medical chaos has a 50-ish swinging-single doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads, dating a patient his own age whom he met on his rounds. Screenplay by ██████ ███████ shows a fair amount of sophistication, though he doesn't have enough material to fill out the picture's last third, and one can almost feel the movie slipping. The subplot about the hospital being investigated for its shoddy business affairs isn't worked out satisfactorily, and it feels highly concocted anyway. Still, ██████ ███████ and ██████ ███████ are a terrific team, ███████ ████████ and ███ ██████ very funny in support. ████████ ██████ █████ keeps it all popping, and even when ███████'s one-liners feel like ████ █████ rejects, █████ zips right along happily. The results are dryly engaging and occasionally quite sweet. Followed by a failed TV series. *** from ****
