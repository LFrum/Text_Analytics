"Back in the Day" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as ██████ ██████, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving ██████) who tries to force ██████ into a life of crime. ██████ also falls in love with Alica (███████ ███) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love ██ Crime.<br /><br />Ja Rule does a competent job as ██████. At least he's trying to act. Ving ██████ is perfect as J-Bone. He brings a lot of energy and menace into the role. ███ ██████ as the preacher is his usual excellent self, but he doesn't do much. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as ██████'s Dad. He needed more screen time. I don't want to say this, but ███ █████ is pretty awful as Mrs. Cooper. She overacts every scene and brings the movie down. ███ Carrere and █████ ████████ are in it but don't do anything substantial for the plot.<br /><br />In the end: You should see it for the skilled performances of Ving ██████ and ███ ██████ and the grittiness of the writing and directing.
