If you liked the ███████ ███████████ version of the Bourne Identity then you will like this too...█████ █████ does this one brilliantly, you can't help but wonder if he is really out there...I reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it's so intense. When I first saw it I was just flicking channels on the remote late one evening..& I got hooked within minutes. look up www.answers.com for █████ ███████ ███████ who is the character that "carlos the Jackal" is based on for both... I remember reading about █████ ███████ ███████'s arrest in the paper in 1997. It was front page for weeks, through the trial after his arrest.
