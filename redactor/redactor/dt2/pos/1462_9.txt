A spin off comedy talk show from the creators of '█████ ████████'s █████████' The new series, ███ to ███ with ████ ███████, focuses on █████'s manager, publisher and publicity agent, as played by ███████ ██████.<br /><br />Nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - ████ ███████ is a one-man brand. <br /><br />After his co-funded Channel 4 television hit █████ ████████'s █████████ he now invites you into his luxury penthouse flat for an all-new, entertaining and immensely stylish TV talk show.<br /><br />███ to ███ with ████ ███████ will feature all Dean's remaining celebrity friends, as well as plenty of live music and fine fish-dish cuisine in a show that reeks of class - but not fish!<br /><br />I attended two of the live recordings and it had me in stitches. There are distinct comparisons to ████ █████████'s 'Knowing me Knowing you' in the layout but ███████ ██████ and ████ ███████'s unique writing style take it to another level.<br /><br />If your a fan of █████████ then you can't miss it. Catch it when its aired late this summer
