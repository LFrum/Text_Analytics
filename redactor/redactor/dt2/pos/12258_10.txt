█████████ ████ {dir. █████ L. ██████, 1987} <br /><br />****/**** <br /><br />Although it lacks the emotional punch of ██████'s debut feature, (Terms of Endearment) █████████ ████ is a superlative film, with exceptional performances from each of the three leads and a script that feels as genuine and well-researched as a hard-hitting news report. Let it be known, this is a character film first and foremost and a satire second. In my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms. The film's characters are given surprising depth and dimension , while the satire remains sly and never bitter. Comparisons to ███████ are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes. While also a great film, ███████ is a cynical and weary work; in other words, its mad as hell and fed up with the state of television. ███████'s style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters populating the news rooms of █████████ ████ love and live for their jobs (sometimes to the detriment of their love lives.) They derive pleasure from the stresses and satisfactions of news reporting, just as the audience derives pleasure from watching this sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece.
