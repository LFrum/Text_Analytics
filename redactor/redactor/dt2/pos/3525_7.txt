Taking its cues from backwoods classics Deliverance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, ████ █████████'s ████ ██████ ████ might not offer much very new in terms of plota maniac stalks and kills a group of campersbut still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the director's deft handling of the material, great use of the stunning scenery, even greater use of women in hot-pants, a brooding synth score from ████ ██████ and a nifty twist towards the end (although one that should be apparent to those who have been paying attention).<br /><br />Thanks to solid performances from its capable castincluding █████ winner ██████ ███████ as forest ranger ███ McLeanthere is a sense of realism to ████ ██████ ████ that is all too often missing from this kind of fare. The film also offers a pretty creepy maniac (who sniggers like ████ █████████'s dog ██████ and uses a nasty serrated machete to kill), and delivers a couple of very imaginative sequences which help lift it above many of its contemporaries: a topless woman (gratuitous nudity box well and truly ticked) in a lake discovers that the hand that has been groping her underwater doesn't belong to her boyfriend; and a shortsighted character makes out with his pal's girlfriend (as a joke), unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer.
