This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the "war is hell" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw ██████████ Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the final segment of the journey with ██████, which encapsulates ██████'s Heart of Darkness, to be rather boring. I finally got around to seeing ██████████ Now █████ and the flaws have been taken care of. █████ makes the movie an outright masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. ██████'s performance now seems full and complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, but much more profound. ██████ Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great to spot a young ████████ ████, █████ █████, etc. in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as. The work of ██████ ██████, ████ ███████, ████████ █████████ and ███ ███████ is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this film, skip the original and head straight for █████. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York █████ from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece.
