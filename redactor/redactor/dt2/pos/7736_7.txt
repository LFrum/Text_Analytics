███████ ███████████ probably didn't envision █████████ as a gay doctor, ███████ as a faithless wife, or Caliban as a goatherd with a Trinitron, but the Bard's had worse done to his good work over time, and might even enjoy the sumptuous pageant of life that is his "Tempest" as re-configured by ████ ████████ and co-writer ████ Capetanos.<br /><br />This time, Prospero is ██████ █████████ (████ ██████████), a Manhattan-based architect tired of designing ████████ ████ casinos for the amiable Mafioso ██████ (Vittorio ███████), especially after discovering ██████ is carrying on an affair with ██████'s wife Antonia (Gena ████████). Along with daughter ███████ (█████ ████████), ██████ escapes to a remote Greek island with ███████ and his new mistress ██████ (█████ ████████), a nice Catholic girl who struggles with ██████'s celibate lifestyle. Will a sudden storm bring all right in the end?<br /><br />Here's a thought on the career of Cassevetes: How many other actors could make a film so confused into something so riveting? A darling of film critics for his earlier work, often with his real-life wife ████████, he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here, but seems to enjoy himself and makes us enjoy him, too. It's not Prospero, but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own.<br /><br />"It's all here," he tells one of his faithful companions, ██████'s dog Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration, and serenity." That it is. "Tempest" transfers 1611 London to 1982 Manhattan and finds some nice resonances in ██████'s displaced life. "Show me the magic", he calls out to a storm-tossed city skyscape, and ████████'s version, augmented by ██████ ████████'s sterling cinematography of purple seascapes and naturally sun-burnished Greek landscapes, does just that.<br /><br />It's not a perfect movie, by any means. In fact, the big finale, which is the only part of the movie that follows ███████████'s storyline to any faithful extent, is a mess. Rowland's character is hard to care much for in this film, and after meeting ████████ in all her braless glory, it's hard to understand ██████'s continuing concern for his wife, let alone his left-field desire to make an unhappy "sacrifice" in order to restore the natural order of things.<br /><br />But there's a lot to love about "Tempest". In addition to ██████████, there's ████████'s film debut as his loyal but restless daughter, here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive rustic "Kalibanos" (████ █████). ████████ here is very much the same teenaged muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire ████ ██████, but with an emotional depth those later Hughes films didn't delve into. ████████ and █████ never got any Oscar attention, but they both would win ██████ ██████ for their playful work here. He tries to woo her in her island isolation with his TV reruns of "Gunsmoke" in Greek, tempted by her 15-year-old body.<br /><br />"I want to balonga you with my bonny johnny," Kalibanos declares, getting shoved aside but winning our sympathy anyway, especially after performing "New York, New York" with a chorus of goats. (When "Tempest" hit the screens, █████ was the toast of Broadway as the lead in "Nine".)<br /><br />It's ████████'s show, even if it feels at times that ██████████ is running things with improvisational line readings and emotional breakdowns galore. (██████ introduces himself to ██████ by telling her "I'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown".) He plays his character as an amiable obsessive, seeking to crystallize his happiness by building an theater in his otherwise uninhabited island.<br /><br />Adding to the enjoyment is ███████'s rich performance as the other man, who is as completely amiable as █████ while telling a youth-obsessed ██████: "Boys don't have half as much fund as we have. They're nervous...and they make love in the back of an old sports car." Despite being overlong and pretentious in spots, like so many art films, "Tempest" is entertaining in its excesses and a trip very much like ███████████ intended, even if his dreams didn't involve smoking pot backstage at a Go-Gos concert.
