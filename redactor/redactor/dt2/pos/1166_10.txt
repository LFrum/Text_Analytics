One of the best 'guy' movies I've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion. Gad, the scenes...<br /><br />████████'s bandits swarm over the wall... A staid British gentleman calmly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. A whisper from the ghost of Empire... Lest we forget! Lest we forget!<br /><br />U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long, long gone ██████████. They were carrying █████, it should have been ████, but, oh wow. And the Winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless Europeans... <br /><br />████████ --████ ███████, o, ███!--wondering 'What kind of gun does Roosevelt use?"<br /><br />Teddy Roosevelt--█████ █████, o, ███!--wondering "What kind of gun does ████████ use?' and writing yet another angry letter to Winchester about the stock on his Winchester 95.<br /><br />████████, armed with but a sword... A Prussian cavalry officer, HOLSTERING his pistol and drawing HIS sword... Honor. That's something long dead, from a world long gone, but ████████ would never have flown a plane full of children into a building...<br /><br />███████ at ███████'s magnificent best, and now out on DVD.
