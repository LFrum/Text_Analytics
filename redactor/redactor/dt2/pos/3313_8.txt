This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are ████ █████, in her first starring role, ████ ██████ and █████ █████. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely ████ ████████. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau. ████ to believe that anyone could reject this beauty for any reason, but █████ ███████, her heart throb, does just this. Sort of takes you back to ████ ██████ rejecting the gorgeous ████████ ██████ in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, doesn't it? █████ █████, the third damsel in distress, meets and dates ██████ █████, before he became the producer, and husband to ███ ███████, he is known for. Hope's boyfriend from home, played by newcomer █████ ██████, is promising to marry her. She also meets ███████ ████, a fellow worker, who has interests in our Hope. All three ladies have their drama ahead of them. Crawford almost steals the film. Her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch. Veteran actor █████ ██████ plays one of the bosses with a yen for pinching our leading ladies' back side. He's delightfully charming. Also in the cast is ██████ ████, wasted in a thankless role never really explored. Too bad as I like this actress who never seems to get that one role to distinguish her abilities. She has a crush on a married man in the office played by ██████ ██████, whom I had the pleasure to work with in a couple of Shakespeare plays in NYC. He is a distinguished actor that is wasted in this film also.<br /><br />All in all it's great fun, in Technicolor and cinemascope, directed by ████ █████████.
