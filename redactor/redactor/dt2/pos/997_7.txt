Where would Hollywood have been without ███████ █████ as ██████ ████████ or ██████ █████ as Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as ███████ ████████ once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.<br /><br />But of all poets it was █████ ██████, the roistering, free-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39), who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II, he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters, in which three old maids in a Welsh village plot the murder of their rich half-brother. All that is now forgiven.<br /><br />In ████ ███████'s The Edge of ████, ██████ is played by the Welsh actor ███████ ████. It's not a full-scale biopic. The film covers four years in the poet's life during World War II, when he lived with two women: his wife ███████ (██████ ██████) and a former lover ████ ████████ (█████ █████████), whom he met again by chance during the war. It seems he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women -- to ██████ and to each other -- is at the heart of ███████'s absorbing film.<br /><br />How it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves. ███████ ██████████, the film's producer, is the granddaughter of ████ ████████ and ███████ ███████. ███████, a war hero (played in the film by ███████ ██████), married ████ while she was still in love with the poet. ██████████ was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents, █████ ██████: A Farm, Two Mansions and Bungalow, by █████ ██████, describing their tangled lives. ███████ █████████, who wrote the screenplay, is the mother of █████████. The part requires █████████ to sing, and her mother included songs especially for her. Surely no film with such felicitous family connections deserves to do other than succeed.<br /><br />We begin in London during the Blitz. Bombs are falling, sirens are wailing, and ████████ is singing to sheltering crowds in an underground Tube station. In a pub, by chance, she meets ██████ and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child. ████████ and ███████ form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs, listening to ██████ read his poems, exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off, as everyone did in wartime. ███████ turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world ("My first was ████████ ████, he seduced me when I was 15"). But it's the refined and soulful ████████ who stirs ██████'s deepest responses and eventually succumbs to his charms. In the meantime, she has reluctantly married ███████, who has seen her in the Tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty (if not her singing).<br /><br />It is an intense and strangely beautiful film, though ██████ himself may be its least impressive character. He is best remembered for Under ████ ████, his verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical Welsh village of █████████, whose name spelt backwards was not something polite English teachers drew attention to. I once had a vinyl recording of ███████ ██████ reading the poem (he appeared in a film of Under ████ ████ in 1971), and I've never forgotten the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the magnetism of the man, is something I missed in Rhys's performance. ██████ comes across as a strangely pallid, even secondary, figure compared with the women in his life.<br /><br />In his previous film, ████ Is the Devil, ███████ explored the turbulent life of painter ███████ █████ and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model, ██████ ████. The Edge of ████ seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what insights it offers into the springs of ██████'s creative inspiration, I would have to say █████████. But as an insight into his egotism, his smouldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others, it is wonderfully sad and revealing.<br /><br />██████ had a good war, boozing and writing while other men (including ███████) were being traumatised by the horrors of battle. In one scene near the end, ██████'s behaviour towards his friends seems unforgivably callous. But this is not, after all, ██████'s film. Murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of war. ██████ is charming and pathetic as the wife. And █████████ looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But this is probably her finest performance. And in every respect the film is worthy of her.
