Fascinating and amusingly bad, ██████ of New York is the first all talkie feature and one that almost never saw the light of day.<br /><br />Two naive barbers (█████ and Gene) from out of town get involved with bootleggers and end up fronting a speak. When a cop is shot by one of the bootleggers the police start to close in, and the Hawk (who shot the officer) decides to pin the murder on █████ instructing his henchman to "take him for a ride". But it's the Hawk himself who takes the bullet in a twist that will surprise few.<br /><br />Shot in one week at a cost of $23,000, "██████" was originally meant as a two reeler but ███ took advantage of ████ ██████'s absence to extend it to six. When ██████ discovered this he ordered ███ to cut it back to the original short. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $25k for the film, did ███████ actually look at the film, which went on to make a staggering $1.3 million.<br /><br />Seen now this is an extremely hokey piece, with acting that ranges from the passable (██████ ████████) to trance like (█████'s Granny in a particularly risible scene) and much of the playing is at the level of vaudeville. Since it's an early talkie (4 part-talkies preceded it) that's about all the characters do, and very slowly at that. The script feels improvised, visual style is non existent (apart from the shooting scene done in silhouette) and scenes grind on interminably. Title cards are intercut which redundantly announce characters and locales.<br /><br />Despite all this "██████" is a compelling experience, as we watch actors and crew struggling with the alien technology, and changing cinema for ever.<br /><br />Catch it if you can
