If you are a fan of early ████ movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than ████, ███, and █████. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that ████'s singing voice was ████ ████████, who is none other than ███ ██████'s twin brother. It has been reported that ███ ██████ was a high school classmate and friend of ████, so twin brother ████ may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one. We don't have to wonder about hidden meanings or try to figure out underlying themes. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and time. It's called entertainment folks!!!
