███████ ███████'s Little Tramp or Little Man character wins World War I, called The Great War at the time, single handedly, even capturing the Kaiser, something the entire ██████ armed forces were unable to do. Too bad it all turns out to be a dream, which is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short (almost a feature film at 46 minutes).<br /><br />There are inventive gags galore including ███████ having to put on a gas mask to eat █████████ cheese sent from home, then using the cheese as a weapon against the Germans; ███████ sleeping underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier he continues to annoy; ███████ disguising himself as a tree--one of his best sketches ever--and ███████ pretending to beat up his friend who has become a POW, then hugging him when the enemy is out of sight.<br /><br />One amazing feature is how much ███████, when he is behind enemy lines dressed as a German, resembles ██████ over ten years before ██████ and his Nazi thugs rose to dominate German politics. Obviously ██████ patterned his appearance after ███████'s from this film.
