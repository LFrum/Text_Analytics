This is one of my personal favorites, a rare little gem that seems to be undiscovered by the general population. █████ Cooper and ████████ ████████ form the heart of the piece in what is a well-chosen cast. Few movies have ever captured the true hostilities that undergirded the Civil War, but this one seems to capture all the right tones and moods. If you're a fan of the book, ████ ████████, try this movie out and see if you don't think it makes a good companion piece.
