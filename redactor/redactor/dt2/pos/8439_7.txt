This is a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern California that was directed by █████ ███████ and stars ████ █████, ████ ██████ and ███████ ███████. █████ plays a TV reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist but is only allowed to be a TV reporter. ███████ is an independent cameraman and ██████ is a supervisor at a nuclear plant. █████ and ███████ are sent on a routine assignment at a nuclear power plant and an accident almost happens and they get it all on film. Everyone tries to cover it up except █████ and ███████, so ███████ steals the film. ██████ starts to investigate and finds out the company cares more about profit then safety at the plant. It's a good movie with a pretty good ending.
