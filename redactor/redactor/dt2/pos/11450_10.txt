I neglected this film when I used to go to the movie store but then the curiosity got to me and I decided to check it out. I loved it!!! The movie starts off with ████ and ███ heading for a Halloween party at the abandoned funeral parlor ████ █████. Then we meet a few more characters, ██████ and Suzzanne ( the hosts), Frannie, ███, ██████, ███ and █████. Then of course they start to party and when they''re really in the mood they decide to have a séance which awakens a demon. The demon possesses ██████ and she starts her gruesome slaughtering. Will they survive the Night of the Demons.<br /><br />The movie was overall great. The gore was fine but the nudity provided by ██████ ███████ (Trash from ROTLD) once again screws it. I never was a fan of hers and never will be.
