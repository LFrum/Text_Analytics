I just want to say that █████ ██████████████'s role as ████████ for that entire show, was ████ worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as █████ ████████ really is....WOW. There were scenes where ██████████████ had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a █████ ████████ impersonation for a couple of minutes. Its another to do it for a whole TV movie.<br /><br />I don't know how I felt about the whole show, and I don't know how much they played with the facts, but I do know that it was █████ ██████████████ that kept me watching. So for that, I give HIM a 10.
