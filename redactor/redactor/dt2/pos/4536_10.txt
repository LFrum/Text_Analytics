This is one of my favourite comedy films. █████ ██████ is hilarious as the accident prone moron and █████ █████ is perfect playing the straight-man to ██████.<br /><br />The dialogue between the two of them is brilliant. The scene where the two of them are in the car singing along to Superstar by The Carpenters is a classic.<br /><br />█████ ██████ was a great comic actor who had amazing potential - he will be sadly missed.<br /><br />
