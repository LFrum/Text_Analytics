LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, engrossing, emotionally-charged HBO-TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor █████ ███████████████ (who also appears in a small role). This joyous motion picture experience is centered around ███████████████'s childhood guardian, ██████ "█████" Crosby, a strong, big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York during the 1950's. █████ was a one-woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks, derelicts, cripples, drug addicts, misfits, and everyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out. The crux of the story revolves around █████'s relationship with young █████ (beautifully played by ██████ ████████),a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so █████ took him in. S. ██████ ████████, who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of Lieutenant Van Buren on NBC's LAW & ORDER, turns in a powerhouse performance as █████, the neighborhood mother-figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town. Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an ████ █████. Merkeson is backed by an impressive all-star cast that includes ████████ ██████ (brilliant and heartbreaking as █████'s husband), █████ ███████ ██ █, █████ █████, █████ █████, ██████ █████, ████ ████, ███████ ██ ████████, ███████ ██████, █████ ███████, ████████ ██████, █████ ██████, Mos Def, and ████ ██████ as the adult █████. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored, this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels, but if for no other reason, is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by S. ██████ ████████, who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it.
