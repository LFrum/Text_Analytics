Directed by ███████ ████████ (Cat People, Out of the Past, █████ of the Demon) and written by ███████ █████ (How Green was My Valley) ████ of the Indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie. Its main character of captain ████ ██████████ is based on a real woman-pirate ████ █████ who actually lived and sailed through 18th century's Atlantic.<br /><br />The film begins with the sea battle where ████'s (Jean Peters) pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to Europe from the South America. As a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome French officer ██████ ██ ████████ (█████ ███████), who is taken prisoner. ████ ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but it's only till she sets him free when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife Molly (█████ █████) with whom he pretty much in love with. ████ begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead. The pirate movie cliché figure of `█████ █████' also makes his appearance here, this time played by ██████ Gomez.<br /><br />Though ████ of the Indies probably appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clichés, it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in Technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by ███████ ████████. 7/10
