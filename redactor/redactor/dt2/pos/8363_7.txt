The Kid Power Hour featured two segments: ████ ████ and ██████. let's start with ████ ████.<br /><br />████ ████ was intended to be a new Archies cartoon, featuring their superhero identities: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), ███████ ████ (Jughead), Superteen (Betty), and Evilheart (Reggie). However, █████████ couldn't get the rights to do it so they tweaked it a bit and came up with this. Here's the breakdown of characters: Captain California (Archie), ████████ ███ (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), █████ ██████ (Veronica), ███ ████████ (Reggie), █████████ ██████ (Mr weatherbee) and ████ █████ (Miss Grundy). The show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. The humor was the typical lame █████████ jokes, but at least it had a sense of fun about it. It was entertaining enough for kids, though not quite up to previous standards.<br /><br />The other segment was ██████!, which was very faithful to the comics, unlike the previous live action show. All of the major villains made appearances, as well as the entire ██████ ██████ (including ████████ ██████, in at least one episode). █████ ██████ had the correct WC Fields voice and shady character, as well as his perpetually acting up "██████bago". ████ █████████, a veteran of 70's TV shows, like Fish, voiced the Big Red Cheese, while ████ ███████████ (████ █████ in the early 6 ███████ ██████ ███ episodes and voice of Skeletor in He-Man) handled Dr. Sivana.<br /><br />The ███████ had always had a sense of whimsy to them, so little alteration was required for their adventures, to meet the Broadcast Standards and Practices requirements (the censors). As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. Amongst the villains who appeared were: Dr. Sivana, █████ ████, ███ ████, ██ █ Mind, ████ ███████, ████, and the crocodile creatures. ██ █ █████ █████ also made his on screen debut.<br /><br />████ ████ is due to be released from BCI, but ██████! is still in limbo, as well as the live-action show. Hopefully, the proposed movie will help shake them loose on DVD. It is well worth watching and deserving of DVD treatment.
