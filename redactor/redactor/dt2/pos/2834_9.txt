Gregory ████ and ███ █████ are competing for the same girl and after ████ sends █████ on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, ████ goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. ████ chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, ████ ████, ███ ██████ ██ █, ███████ █████ among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by ███████ ███████ Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer. The idea of using this type of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later including "The Dirty Dozen" made in 1967.
