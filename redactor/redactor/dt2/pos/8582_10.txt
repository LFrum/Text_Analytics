A fabulous film,which I have now watched several times over since buying the video only four days ago.Yes I am a █████ █████ Fan and █████ was his usual talented, natural gorgeous self.<br /><br />The interaction between █████ (███████ █████)and █████(█████, ████'s 7 year old Son) was very special and so natural to watch. They were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings. The scenes which I loved the most was █████ and ████ sitting on the wall chatting and ████ then falling backwards off the wall in an hilarious fashion (I won't reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot). Also very hilarious was █████ quizzing ████ about sex, █████ and █████ were perfect in this scene and making what can be an awkward subject between adult and child just so natural. █████s words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all! just brilliant. Credit, of course, must also go to █████ ███████ for his delightful portrayal of █████. He played such a lovable and cheeky child character. The two actors were just perfect together.<br /><br />The interaction between █████ (████) and Nia (████)was perfectly balanced and I couldn't agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch, displaying love,tension and of course passion. It was exciting to see how their delicate blossoming romance gradually unfolded, also showing how their cultural and social divides affected their relationship and was good to see how █████ and Nia sensitively portrayed ████ and ████ discovering, accepting and overcoming these differences. It kept me fixed to the TV and guessing right until the end of the film. <br /><br />█████s portrayal of ████'s vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed, so much so, that I found it was difficult to watch when ████ was so mean and childish towards █████ because he (████) felt that █████ was getting in the way of his romance/relationship with ████ ██████ ████.One couldn't help feeling very disappointed, angry and frustrated with ████ for treating █████ this way and this in turn threatening to spoil █████ special relationship with █████ and ████. █████s special talent of 'getting inside a character's head' and displaying to the audience the different sides of a character, was very much in evidence here and pure magic to watch. I must also mention that █████ also has such a good rapport with young actors (see also 'My life so far'a wonderful and not to be missed film).<br /><br />I also loved the relationship between ███████ and his wife █████, both were excellent in displaying to the audience the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all seemingly 'Happy █████████' are quite what they may seem from the outside. <br /><br />I mustn't forget to mention the reverend whom I thought was very funny, in a serious sort of way! Also ████'s Mother and family were hilarious as well as bringing across the importance of ████'s culture and her situation.<br /><br />The downside, I can't really find a downside,but to be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review, the only negative comment that I would make is that the script writers didn't explain in enough detail as to why ████ collapsed in the car, there was only a vague suggestion, from ████, of something being wrong with his heart. However, this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film, far from it.I just needed to rewind the tape a little for a 2nd take.<br /><br />I felt that this film had it all, entertaining, uplifting and I loved the rich colours and sunny scenery.The film warmed up a cold winters day and made me smile :-)) All the essential elements were there,laughter,love,tension,sadness,anger,drama and a Warm feel good factor, with, yes plenty of those delicious █████ █████ moments including a very soaked █████ in a 'Wet Shirt scene',not to be missed by any fan, what more could a girl want;-)) <br /><br />I would strongly recommend this film, specially to any █████ █████ Fans ;-)
