EIGHTEEN as written and directed by ███████ ████ may have a few too many stories to tell simultaneously for a 102 minute movie to completely succeed, but there is such a fine sense of commitment on the part of all the cast and crew that the viewer ends up wanting the movie to work - and so it does. Yes, aspects could have been finessed if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut, but as a small independent movie from Canada this is a tender, gently humorous, very touching tale about vulnerability and communication and commitment. It works on many levels.<br /><br />In a very well choreographed opening we are voyeurs at a family dinner where obviously something has gone awry and results in a father and two sons taking off in a car and having an accident in which one of the sons is killed. With an introduction like that the mood is set for the surviving 18-year old ███ son (████ ███████ - looking far too old for credibility as a teenager) to desert his family and live on the streets. He meets █████ (Clarence Sponagle) a male prostitute who gives ███ food and shelter, █████ (the very fine █████ ████) who saves him from a bashing by her associate Derek (████ ████████) and becomes romantically entangled with ███, and ██████ █████ (████ ███████) in a finely wrought sympathetic role as a priest. It is ███'s 18th birthday and his father (█████ █████) traces ███ down to give him a present from his deceased grandfather with instructions the gift should be opened on ███'s 18th birthday.<br /><br />███, though drinking too much and full of anger, pawns the tape machine but keeps the tape and begins to listen to the words of his grandfather █████ (voice by ███ ████████) who recounts his own 18th birthday in WW II in France where he (now the very sensitive actor ███████ ████████) has an experience with a wounded medic named Macauley (████ ████████, also superb) and reflects on his one night marriage with a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of 'Queer as ████' fame and a fine singer and actress here), only for something to live for during the war: █████ offers succor to Macauley as he dies, with a beautiful scene of redemption for he two men at the end. The parallels of ███ and grandfather █████ interplay every time ███ listens to the tape and lead ███ to ultimately alter his view of life and love. Subplots include █████'s isolated existence as a hustler being altered by Jeff (█████ ███████ - in a surprisingly fine film debut) who simply wants to be loved; by an unexpected pregnancy between █████ and ███; by the trust ██████ █████ instills in both ███ and █████ in a good shepherd's manner: and by a flashback to the car accident where ███ could have saved his brother ██████ (████ ███████) from an abusive act at the hands of his father, just before the accident, but failed to do so, opening his deep guilt and resultant misplaced anger, mirrored by his grandfather's taped experiences. Each of these subplots pulls together at the end, creating a sense of closure for each of the people involved.<br /><br />There are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production: the musical score by Bramwell Tovey is performed by the Vancouver Symphony members, the cinematography by █████ ███ ███████ is aptly atmospheric, and the general quality of acting by this Canadian cast is very fine. Though ████ ███████ handles his role well, casting a very young teenager in the pivotal main role would have made the story work much better, and ███████ ████, with only one other film 'Two Brothers' on his resume, gives promise of a young talent to watch. Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a worthwhile film and deserves attention. █████ Harp
