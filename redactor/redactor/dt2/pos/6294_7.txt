Along with In the Army!, this ranks as one of █████ █████'s best movies, if there is such a thing. While the whole West Coast-meets- Midwest-culture-clash isn't anything new, this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh █████. While the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction, the whole concept was rather entertaining. Not only was █████'s interaction with the family hilarious, it also had █████ ██████ and Tiffani- Amber Theissen (she'll always have the Amber in my book) in two ravishing and early roles. One of those films I have no problem watching when it is on TV.
