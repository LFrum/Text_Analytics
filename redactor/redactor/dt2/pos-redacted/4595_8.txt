I've never seen a movie get a worse release then this. And that's a shame, as this is the funniest film of the year! You would think an ad with the line "From the director of "Office Space"" would be enough to warrant a big release! But there are no ads, no posters, no website , I doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend. What is 20th Century *** thinking? **** Judge's Sci-Fi comedy is set in 2505 but it could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) **** ****** and Maya Rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards. The film reminds me of ***** *****'s "Sleeper" ,"RoboCop", "Planet of the Apes", "Blade ******" and "*******" and the late great "Futurama". Try to see it before *** burns all the prints!
