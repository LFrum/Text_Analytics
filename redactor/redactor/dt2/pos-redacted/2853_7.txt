***** ********* is a Kansas housewife whose domineering husband is mixed up in drug trafficking. Two professional hit men -- ****** ******* and his son, ***** ****, murder the husband in his dining room. *********, unobserved by the killers, witnesses this and undergoes a dissociative reaction, assuming the personality of a nurse -- the eponymous ***** -- who is a character in her favorite soap opera. Believing herself to be the TV character, ********* takes off in her husband's car, which has a load of dope in the trunk, and travels to LA where she hopes to link up with another character in this mindless afternoon drama, "Dr. ***** ******", **** *******. Not realizing she is being pursued by the two hit men, she drives to LA where she manages to link up with ******* and is actually written into the show as a nurse named *****. A handful of men in the know, including the local sheriff, catch on to what's happening and also seek ********* in LA. The ending is believable and poignant.<br /><br />If that sounds crazy, it's because it is. And it's the writer's responsibility, **** ** ********. The curious thing is that ******** and the director, **** ******, with considerable help from the performers, just about pull it all off. This isn't a plot that has been cast in a familiar mold. Nope. I give it bonus points for sheer originality. Somebody went out on a limb. Somebody took a chance on a movie that was NOT a copy or remake of something that had made money ten years or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved, down on their knees every night, praying fervently. I don't know if the film was remunerative but it's mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms.<br /><br />It's what might be called an "initial premise" movie. You start off with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of *********'s husband and her adoption of a genuinely new personality, and follow the resultant logical paths realistically. "Groundhog Day" is another, better and more intricately plotted, example. "***** *****" has its logical cracks, where the incidents give up their plausibility. Eg., at a party in LA, ********* finally runs into *******, the guy who plays her ex-fiancé on TV. She's stunned (because, after all, she thinks she's *****, who lost her fiancé long ago). She approaches ******* and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as "***** *****", the character. She addresses ******* by the name of his TV character, "***** ******." The group are puzzled at first, then convince themselves that she's an aspiring actress who insists on staying "in character" during the conversation -- and afterward, too, after ******* has become fascinated by her and the others bored. ******* drives her home and even when she kisses him goodnight, she's still in character, leaving ******* wide-eyed with astonishment at the relentless way she captures the character of *****. On the next date, ******* returns her love. That development, the relationship between ********* and ******* at this point, is a crack in the logic, the kind that's absent from "Groundhog Day." By the end of ***** ***, *******, like any other person, would realize that ********* is a few clowns short of a circus.<br /><br />The rest of the film, which includes many digressions, succeeds beyond expectations. The relationship between ****** ******* and his insolent, nihilistic son is marvelously spelled out. Morgan is flawless in his exasperation. He manages to fall in love with the image of ********* as he unearths clues to her whereabouts and activities, and at the end he can't bring himself to shoot her. She's too sweet to shoot. After her transformation into *****, she left a note behind in Kansas. "I want to help all life, whether it be animal, plant, or mineral." Who could harm the author of such a preposterous connative statement? His admiration of her comes as an epiphany, as he stands near one of the floodlights at the rim of the Grand Canyon. *********, dressed as *******, or maybe the Good Witch of the East -- well, characters that, like *********, are from Kansas anyway -- appears to ******* and he embraces her and kisses her tenderly. It's a scene that's at once eerie, romantic, and a little spooky. I once stood at one of those lights and threw some shredded paper into the updraft from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats who had misperceived the fluttering shreds as moths.<br /><br />Right. Where was I? Okay. I was trying not to run out of space. *********'s performance deserves plaudits. Everything she does, every movement, every utterance, is naive and tentative. She really IS a likable character -- and that despite the fact that she's no glamor girl by Hollywood standards. But -- what an actress. Compare her performance as the bumptious 19th-century hick in "Cold Mountain." Just the opposite. But then everyone is up to snuff in this enjoyable film. ******* ******** does a fine job in a minor role. Watch her when she tells **** ******* that she's considering killing off his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident. ******* is one of those narcissists who wears the kind of ten-thousand dollar thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time. He chuckles and says, "Oh, one of those castaway deals, right? Okay, how do I get back?" ******** doesn't answer. She just smiles at him with those enormous blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly.<br /><br />Not a masterpiece of film-making but a good, original, professional job by everyone concerned.
