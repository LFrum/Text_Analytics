This was essentially a remake of "********* ******" minus ******** ******, ***** **** & ******* *********. **** is playing a college professor who teaches Criminology 101 and can't even find his own classroom. ***** is now a private eye, not related to ****. This lets ***** shoot at guys speeding away from him, which a cop can not do. ***** still gets the girl in the end. ****** Needham portrays the girl. She is the prime suspect and **** and ***** believe she's innocent and prove it. That's all the spoiler you get. The ending is sufficiently unexpected that you don't already know it half way through the movie.<br /><br />Don't take it seriously. Don't critique it. Just sit back and enjoy **** and ***** *** ****.
