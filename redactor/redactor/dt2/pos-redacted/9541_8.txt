This almost perfect cinematic rendition of ***** ******'s popular children's novel follows the lives of Roberta (******), *******, and *****, and their mother, after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison. They go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country which stands near a railway line  mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and, specifically, waving to one particular train to 'send their love to father'.<br /><br />Always an involving and clever novel, the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). ***** ******* plays ******, while ***** ******** and **** ****** are her sister and brother. Their mother is ***** ********, while the other memorable characters are played by ******* ******** (Perks the railway-man) and ******* ****** (the old gentleman on the train).<br /><br />'The ******* ********' is gentle entertainment from another age, but does its job beautifully. As we watch ****** grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture. Throughout we have a sense of time and place  be it from the steam trains, the university paper chase, or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls (and used to avert disaster!).
