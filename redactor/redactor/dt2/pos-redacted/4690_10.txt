Used to watch this when i was very little, then used to watch my videos. Now i watch the DVDs, i love this. *** Winston is 'The ****', the rest of the cast is all good and even with the changing of ***** **** it all works. Great stories, twists and the way it was shot - to the untrained eye (not that mine is trained) can be miss-interpreted as being ropey but it adds to the films absorption of the audience. With the green hillsides and the contrast of the lush sunny lit forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles - Its great. Personally the definitive interpretation of the ***** **** legend. I cannot stress how much i think you should watch this, if you get a chance then YOU MUST WATCH IT.
