In ******'s S.O.S, ********* goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and ******, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, ****** and ****** provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. ********* also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, ****** replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now ********* can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by **** ******* starring the popular cat-and-bird duo. ******'s S.O.S is most highly recommended.
