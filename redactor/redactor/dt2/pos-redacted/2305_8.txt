In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the litter carrier ******** (Takahiro Tamura), **** (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (******* ****). Toyiji becomes jealous of ******** and plots with **** to kill him. They strangle ******** and dump his body inside a well in the woods, and **** tells the locals that ******** moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of ********, and **** is haunted by his ghost. The situation becomes unbearable to **** and Toyiji when a police authority comes to the village to investigate the disappearance of ********.<br /><br />"Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. The remorse and the guilty complex of **** make her see the ghost of her murdered husband, spoiling the perfect plot of her lover. The cinematography is jeopardized by the quality of the VHS released in Brazil, but there are very beautiful scenes, inclusive "Ringu" and the American remake "The Ring" use the view of the well from inside in the same angle. The performances and direction are excellent making "Ai no Borei" a great movie. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Imp√©rio da ******" ("The Empire of Passion")
