If you wish to see ***********'s masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this BBC version. Indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but ******'s performance as ****** and ******* *******'s as ******** are well worth the effort.<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me how clear "******" is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the Bard. Every film version of "******" has tinkered with its structure. ******* concentrated on ******'s indecision, ****** on his passions. ****** is able to pull all of these aspects of ******'s character together with the aid of ***********'s full script.<br /><br />Why does ****** not kill ******** immediately? ****** says "I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious..." ****** is extremely upset, not only for his father's death (and suspected murder), or his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because ******** has usurped the throne belonging to ******. He is furious at his mother for marrying ******** (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified ********' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself. He is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance. He cannot simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so. He must "out" the King's secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment ****** is successful in displaying ********' guilt in public, he has opportunity to kill him and does not. WHY? He wants it ALL! He wants revenge, the throne AND the damnation of ********' soul in hell. ****** OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his undoing. He kills ******** thinking it is ******** and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, *******, Gertrude, ******** and ****** himself.
