"Classes tous risques" is one of the best "gangsters" films noirs France has ever produced.Perfect cast :**** *******,a young **** -**** Belmondo (who made "a bout de souffle",******'s thing, the same year),****** ***** and a fine supporting cast ;brilliant script by **** ******** -who also wrote "le trou" ******'s masterpièce the same year!What a year for him!;wonderful black and white cinematography by ******** Cloquet.And taut action,first-class directing by ****** ******,who surpasses ****-Pierre ******** .Whereas the latter films gangsters movie with metaphysical pretensions,which sometimes lasts more than two hours,****** ****** directs men of flesh and blood,and the presence of the two children adds moments of extraordinary poignancy which ******** has never been able to generate .And ****** avoids pathos,excessive sentimentality:the last time ******* sees his children,coming down in the metro (subway)is a peak of restrained emotion.<br /><br />******* portrays a gangster whose die is cast when the movie begins.He thinks that he can rely on his former acquaintances ,but they are all cowards -we are far from manly friendship dear to ******* ****** ("touchez pas au grisbi" ) which ******** was to continue throughout the sixties-sometimes abetted by mean women (the film noir misogyny par excellence),living in a rotten microcosm,ready to inform on -we are far from **** ******'s simplistic behavior in ******'s "opus"-.<br /><br />Cloquet works wonders with the picture:the scene on the beach in a starless night when the two children see their mother die after the shoot-out with the customs officers is absolutely mind-boggling.<br /><br />There's a good use of voice-over,which ****** only uses when necessary;thus ,the last lines make the ending even stronger than if we have attended the scenes.<br /><br />****** ****** had found a good niche ,and he followed the "classes tous risques" rules quite well with his follow-up "l'arme à gauche" (1965) which featured ******* again and made a good use of a desert island and a ship.Had he continued in that vein,France would have had a Howard Hawks.In his subsequent works ,only "Max et les ferrailleurs " (1971) showed something of the brilliance he displayed in the first half of the sixties.He had become ,from "les choses de la vie" onwards,the cinema de qualité director who used to focus on tender-hearted bourgeois in such works as "***** et *******" (1972),"******* ******** ,**** et les autres" (1974) or "Mado" (1976)
