Here in Germany "King of Queens" has a big big cult status! Nearly every teenager (and adults) watch this sitcom. It's really awesome!! Better than the other horrible American sitcoms like "**** *****" or "Set by ****" (the only series, who is still OK, is "** *****"). There haven't been an Amercian sitcom in Europe who was as effective as this really funny show!! ***** ***** and Leah Remini as **** & ****** ********* are the craziest couple I know, ***** ******* as ****** is the funniest "grandpa" I know, and ****** ******** and (especially) ****** ****** as Deacon & Spence are the most different, but funny guys I know. I watch it as often as I could, and I still haven't enough, good humor!
