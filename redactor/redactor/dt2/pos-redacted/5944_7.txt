If you're going to spoof ***** **** it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles BOTH Sean Connery and ******* ******** so step forward **** ******** who captures perfectly the Connery sneer that masquerades as a smile plus the self-delusion of Rossiter thinking he is suave. Dujardin plays it like a Clouseau who can hold his own at karate. The plot has him looking for Our Man In Schtook who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such improbabilities as a Nazi cell concealed inside a pyramid. If there is a jarring note it is the leading lady, Berenice Bejo who has all the sensuality of a suet pudding and is eclipsed - but only just - by **** *****. It's good for one viewing but that's about it.
