How did they get that cinematic shot of the car colliding with the back end of the semi? And then *** sits up -- great! Looks like the DVD is scheduled for May of 2006 - about time!! Watch this on a large screen or film revival in a theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian Job with ******* *****; ****** with ***** *******; To **** and Die in LA with the CSI guy when he was young; French Connection with **** *******; ***** with ****** ******; Vanishing ***** with ***** ******; Enemy of the State with ******* again -- What are your favorites?
