I taped this on Sundance and had no idea that it was a ***** film. I thought it was just another kung fu movie.<br /><br />Then I saw things like the dancing sax player <br /><br />who sounded like an Oriental Gato Barbieri, and I knew this had to be *****.<br /><br />I missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see *****'s credits.<br /><br />So far he hasn't disappointed me yet. Audition, City of Lost Souls, Ichi the Killer and The Happiness of the Katakuries were all good flicks, and now I've found out that this was the third in a trilogy.<br /><br />Other than ***** and **** ******* there's nobody making interesting films nowadays.
