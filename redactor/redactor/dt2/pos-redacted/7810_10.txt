There have been very few great comedy films in the history of ***** ******. ***** Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (***** and ******) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (*******). ***** and ****** **** try their best to outwit each other and woo *******. The plot thickens when ****** ***** & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with ***** and ****** together (probably the only film!). Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. ***** Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. ****** **** gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. ******* plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and ******** who is *******'s assistant/friend is also funny. ****** *****, ****** *****, ****** ******, ***** *****, ******* and **** ******** just add to the flavour of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.<br /><br />P.S - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, ****** ******, ****** ** ****, ***** *****, **** ***** (old and new), etc.
