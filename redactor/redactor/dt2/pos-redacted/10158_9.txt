I have been getting into the Hitchcock series very much lately. I find myself always renting one of his movies when I'm at Blockbuster or ********* *****. Like I said before, ********* is loosing it's touch incredibly, I needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there. Not to mention, I want to be a film appreciator, not a movie buff. Is there any better way to do that than with ****** *********'s movies? <br /><br />The Man who knew too Much is another great and exciting thriller starring ******'s favorite leading man ***** ****** and the woman who steals the show ****** Day. They play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells ***** some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. ***** seems to just doubt ****** and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back, but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick.<br /><br />The acting again, I would say that ****** was the one who outshined the whole cast. ***** did a great job keeping up, together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film. I loved the little bit of comedy at the end that ****** added. You'll see what I mean. I would always highly recommend this film, despite not being the best Hitchcock film, it's still a treasure.<br /><br />9/10
