I'm not going to go into too much depth, but ******** was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, ****** ** **** is good as usual and ***** ****** pulls off a pretty funny performance. **** Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was **** *******' (***** ******'s) buddy at the gym played by *** ********. I supposed he was just a friend of ****'s, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character that I liked was ***** *******'s (****** ** ****'s) fellow cop/partner played by ****** *******. I guess he was just another cop working with ***** *******, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or what not. I think maybe I'm putting too much thought into a movie, I mean after all, it's a comedy...who cares about the characters? I guess I do though. I was really pleased to see this was directed by *** ***, who also directed ******** ****. Ever since I saw that movie I was looking forward to his next work. I think he did a pretty good job with this film, and I again look forward to his next work.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good movie, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die-hard ****** ** ****/***** ******/**** Russo fan. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not for full price, I'd recommend seeing it at matinee price. <br /><br />Also, here's some movie trivia for ya. The guy who played the camera man, played by ***** *********** is the guy in the music video "Everyday" by **** ******** band. He was also the clerk in "Meet The Parents", also starring ****** ** ****. ...And on top of that he also played ***** *********'s brother in "Zoolander" (both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star *** *******). Just some useless trivia for ya.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,<br /><br />-Chris
