The last of the sequels,not counting ****** and ******** meet ************ which was more or less a spoof.this time count ******* (**** *********)takes center stage seeking a cure for his vampirism from a kindly doc(****** *******).well good ole ***** ******(Lon Chaney Jr)shows up also seeking a cure.the good doc succeeds in curing *****'s werewolfism,but ******* tricks the doc and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doc a crazed lunatic.oh and all this time big Franky(***** strange)lies on a table awaiting his electricity fix so he can wreak some havoc.this was kind of a short movie,around 70 minutes and some change,but the action is there,and the great actors are there as well.Lionel atwill turns up as a police inspector,heres some trivia,Lionel atwill appeared in son of ************,ghost of ************,************ meets the wolf-man,and house of ************. and then this one.if there was another in the series they May have added the creature from the black lagoon to the line up,I'm giving house of ******* 8 out of 10.
