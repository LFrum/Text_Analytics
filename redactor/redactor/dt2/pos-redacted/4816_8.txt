This eloquent, simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. Though a theatrical release, it has a "made-for-TV" quality. We can attribute this to the director, **** *************, who learned his craft in the early days of live television in New York City. Indeed, he directed the teleplay on which the film is based, "Deal a Blow," on the CBS drama series "******." "Young ********" represents his Hollywood debut. After a hiatus of four years, during which he would do more television, he returned to direct "The Young Savages" with **** ********* and, a year after that, "All Fall Down" with ****** ****** and ****** Lansbury.<br /><br />The casting is competent with ***** **** and *** ****** (particularly good) playing the parents of the title character performed by ***** ********* (his first theatrical film) who played the same role in the television version which was his first appearance on the small screen. Look for ***** ******* and **** ******* in supporting roles.
