The best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it. I have watched this movie least 10 times over the past 12 years and still it makes me laugh as if i was watching it for the first time. I have great liking for good comics like the Orgazmo,Cheech n chong, ***** ****** series and many others but this one in ****i is one of my favorite outstanding movies. Some of them recently in ****i are Golmaal,Munnabhai series and ********* series. SO all i can say is **** comedy is finally evolving. But ****** **** **** is pretty different from the movies i have said above. Its what i call the ****i stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in ****i cinema.Cheers to ******** ******** for the brilliant movie.
