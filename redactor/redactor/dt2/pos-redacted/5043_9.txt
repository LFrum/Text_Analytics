The main cast:<br /><br />********* ******* .... ********* **** ****** ********** .... ****** ****** ********* ******** .... ***<br /><br />Director ******** ******** gives this charming story of elderly folks enchanting twists that make the characters appealing, really universal.<br /><br />********* **** is retired and on a pension, his previous occupation unknown. He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty-four years, ******. His son **** covets the spacious apartment as a problem-solver as he needs to house one of his ex-wives and several of their children. The son isn't a vicious schemer, just a guy with one past spouse too many and a blind eye to the attachment his dad has for the flat (which he moved into after relinquishing a previous residence to the son).<br /><br />**** and his also elderly close friend, **, spend there more than ample free time doing small con jobs not for money but for the pleasure of putting one over on easily duped folks like estate agents. A favorite ploy is for **** to act the part of a retired divo of New York's Metropolitan Opera returning home in need of a sprawling mansion. ** is his companion as gullible realtors fall all over themselves proffering chauffeured limousines and fine French restaurant meals in hope of a lucrative sale.<br /><br />When not engaged in well-planned scams, the duo engage in quick ploys such as pretending to be railroad security agents so as to snatch kisses from breathless and ticketless teens trying to sneak onto trains. Chaste kisses, that is: there's no lechery here.<br /><br />****'s long-suffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to insure that the couple, individually and jointly, have a grand funeral, an event the life-loving ********* is in no hurry to experience.<br /><br />Disagreements about money and *********'s promiscuous disposition of marital funds lead to a crisis whose resolution rings both real and endearing. Michalek fishes for the viewer's emotions but he does it openly, honestly and effectively.<br /><br />"****** ******," subtitled of course, is a product of an increasingly vibrant Czech cinema. It wasn't shown widely in the U.S. but its availability on DVD will, hopefully, bring this affecting flick to a wide audience. Sadly, ******* recently succumbed to cancer so this movie is a valedictory to a fine actor who imbued his character with a passion for life's pleasures that must have reflected the actor's own values.<br /><br />9/10.
