Hooray for Korean cinema! Last year I saw "*********" and "Nowhere to hide", now I catch up with *** ******'s directorial debut "Christmas in august". The variety of themes and level of achievement speak highly of a national cinema ripe for discovery. This film's major themes are death and love. The graceful and thoughtful way **** ***(*** Suk-kyu) copes with his impending death, and the sublimation of his desires toward *****(Shim Eun-Ha) out of true love for her. I was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, shielding ***** from unnecessary pain without rejecting her.<br /><br />The success of this type of film is predicated on the skill of the actors. *** and Shim excel, being both quite expressive yet naturalistic. A number of secondary characters, **** ***'s relatives, friends, and clients, are quickly delineated to enrich the story without detracting from its main focus. To LIVE is to love, but all things must pass. Pain subsides. Life goes on.
