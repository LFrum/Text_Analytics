This outing of ****** includes one of his best sidekicks ever, ***** ******. ****** makes the film. ****** and ****** compete for the laughs and both receive plenty. ****** works for a small "no where" town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong the city fathers, allow ****** to take the fall. ***** ******'s character befriends ****** and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and *****'s good name. This film shows the usual *****'s scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film. This may have been ******' last good outing. When you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon, *** ******.
