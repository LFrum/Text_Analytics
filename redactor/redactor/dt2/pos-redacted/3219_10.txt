i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like *******. my friends say that i talk and act like *******. ******* and **** have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it. my vocabulary has widened from watching ******* *****. Lauren graham and ****** bled el are perfect for the parts of ******* and ****. i think **** and ******* should get married because ***** has left ******* and **** way too many times. and has broken *******'s heart too many times too.
