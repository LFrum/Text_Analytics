******* *******'s "The Couch Trip" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a stinging satire it really is. It is also *** *******'s best movie, made in a particularly great film year (1988)for him. First, "The Great Outdoors" and now this.<br /><br />******* stars as **** *****, a career crook who fakes insanity to escape prison. Now, a dumb comedy would just be about this. But "The Couch Trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. Beverly ***** psychiatrist ****** ******* (******* ******, subtly hilarious here)has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected: ******** *****, who happens to be *******'s psychiatrist! You can pretty much guess what's going to happen, but the great thing about "The Couch Trip" is not what happens, but how it is done. <br /><br />"The Couch Trip" gives *** ******* the best role he has ever had. His **** ***** is one of the truly original comic creations in movie history. Wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it, but what makes it special is that ******* makes ***** a lovable character. We root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time.<br /><br />But ******* isn't alone here. He gets strong support from other great comic actors. ****** ******* joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to *****' secret and commits genteel blackmail. ******* ****** "slow burns" his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist. ****** has been one of the most underappreciated actors in Hollywood. It's criminal they haven't used him more often. ******* Romanus plays ******'s slimeball lawyer to perfection.<br /><br />"The Couch Trip" is one of many films made by the now-defunct Orion ******** *********** that are currently unseen. MGM spent a fortune buying the Orion library but have yet to truly cash in on their acquisition. "The Couch Trip" joins "Dressed to ****", "Blow Out" and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault. Shame on MGM for their inaction. Hopefully, with new management, "The Couch Trip" will find the audience and respect it deserves.<br /><br />**** out of 4 stars
