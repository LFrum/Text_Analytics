Being a ***** fan, I originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the ***** and the losing of four superbowls. But once I began to watch, I felt really connected. It was actually nice to see the "*****" win the superbowl, and I must say, that for a TV movie it was actually very well done. *** Bellows as the QB, and *** ****** as the old-school ***** did a very fine job. 8 out of 10
