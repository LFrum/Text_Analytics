"Murder Over New York" is fun, but not as good as most of the other Fox ****s. This film would have been better named, "******* **** in New York", the film's working title. This is *****'s chance to play **** in the Big Apple. There is a lot to like here, though, including guest star ***** ****** of the Three Stooges.<br /><br />This has one of my favorite **** sayings, "Coincidence like ancient egg--leave unpleasant odour." ***** and Yung are good in this one and so is the supporting cast. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere which I look for in these films. Still, it is good to see.
