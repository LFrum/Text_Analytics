The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of ****** is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls ****** and his former girlfriend (when he was human) *******. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between ****** and ******* and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre. This made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies. All up even if your not a Child's Play fan give this one a go.
