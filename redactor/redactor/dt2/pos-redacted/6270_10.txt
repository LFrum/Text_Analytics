The **** series is a shining example of what B-movies should be. They fail in every aspect, but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad. "**** l'invincibile 2" aka "The Blade Master" aka "**** ********" shows us Europe's favorite Conan clone, **** where we left him in the first movie- after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film. This time the world must be saved from "The Nucleus", a kind of bomb, represented on screen as a bright light (I guess they couldn't afford a prop). This one features invisible attackers and samurai. As with the first film, lots of stock footage is used (including one rather obvious bit from "**** ****"). Thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad- this is an exception B-movie.
