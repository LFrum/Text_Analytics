A **** ****** MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon.<br /><br />STEAMBOAT WILLIE, a mischievous little rodent, neglects his pilothouse and frolics his way into cinematic history.<br /><br />On 18 November 1928, a struggling young genius debuted the world's first successful cartoon with synchronous sound. There would be no looking back for either **** ****** or his alter ego ****** *****. Financial struggles would remain, but essentially the world was their oyster bed and ****** would eventually rival ******* as the most recognizable cultural icon of the century.<br /><br />As entertainment, STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to watch, featuring fine work by animator Ub ****** and showing a ****** with all the passions & indifference of a small child. He must deal with a tyrannical skipper (****, without his peg leg; he had been appearing in ****** cartoons since February of 1925), a wisecracking parrot (in a few years it would be a Duck) and a cute little ***** named ******. Together the two rodents rather callously make music on the live bodies of a goat, cat, goose, piglets & cow (a precursor of Clarabelle) - all of whom happened to be conveniently on board the steamship. Audiences howled for more and the pattern was set for the subsequent ***** cartoons of the next few years.<br /><br />******************************<br /><br />**** ****** (1901-1966) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings. As a lad in Marceline, ********, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper; later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub ******, **** developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe. Business reversals sent ****** & ****** to Hollywood in 1923, where ****'s older brother *** became his lifelong business manager & counselor. When a mildly successful series with ****** The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor, the character of ****** ***** sprung into ****'s imagination, ensuring ******'s immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made ******'s screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music. The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and ****'s growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development, an arena in which ****'s genius was unbeatable. ******'s feisty, naughty behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions: temperamental ****** ****, intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for ****'s grandest dream - feature length animated films. Against a blizzard of doomsayers, **** persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of **** *****, *********, *****, ***** & ***** ***. **** never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse, or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off.
