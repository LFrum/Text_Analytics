Another "oldie but goody" from about the same time as "Out of Towners" is "****** ******", with a great cast: ****** ****, in her first film appearance (pre-facelifts), ****** ******** in one of her later ones, and the ever-funny ****** *******. The story is about a dentist who pretends to be married in order to have an excuse for not marrying his girlfriend, leading to the need to come up with a fictitious wife for proof. He cajoles his spinster receptionist (*******) into taking the role, leading to multiple comic disasters and surprising romantic turns. It's in the same vein as the Doris Day/Rock Hunter comedies. Fans of those - as I am - will like this movie; if not, don't bother.
