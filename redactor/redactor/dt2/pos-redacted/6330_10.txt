******* is a sublime comedy director and writer. This fact becomes apparent in "En lektion I kärlek", where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep, yet very emotional scenes. This movie is paves the way for *******'s later comedies "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodröm", all of them starring ****** *********** as well as *** ********. This is an excellent movie with which to start your ******* experience, acutely portraying emotional troubles of the young as well as the old. The cinematography by ****** ***** is astounding, for instance in the picnic scene. In short, the movie is a perfect example of a successful comedy, with a clarity of depth even surpassing some of *******'s own comedies.
