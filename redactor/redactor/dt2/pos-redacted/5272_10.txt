The phenomenon ***** ********* defies easy description or quick categorization. Yet, for the international audience not acquainted to him, one could say he's something like a crude mix of ***** ** ********* and **** *******, adding a foible for Jazz music and 70s outfits. While his stage performances already are eccentric, his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous.<br /><br />"00 Schneider" is, in my opinion, *****'s best movie. He stars in the two leading roles - police detective "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and murderer-villain "***** ******", and also in a precious smaller role as physician "Dr. *********".<br /><br />In the opening scene, we see how modern-art-loving ****** accidentally kills the circus clown ********* *********, from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used ******, when a beloved sculpture slips out of ******'s hands, fatally hitting Metulskie. Upon reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick, Lt. Koerschgen, who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name. They pick up ******'s track quickly, and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion (one of the movie's best scenes!), but initially fail to gather any proof. The story winds through many turns, with several scenes that don't always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny, such as a daydream by 00 (including the most unusual view on a running man's brief-clad crotch in movie history), a police-department party during which Koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized, and a visit at the already mentioned Dr. *********'s. ******, then, is finally caught attempting to escape to *** de ******* on a plane.<br /><br />Always worth special mention is ******* ***** who in this case plays 00's wife, as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in *****'s Movies.<br /><br />So all you folks out there looking for new laughs, I strongly recommend this movie. The catch? You have to understand German (as I doubt there's an English version around)...
