***** ***** hilariously demolishes *******'s attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival *******'s own. ************** and sets are top notch.<br /><br />***** ******* and ***** ******* offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film. Appearances by ****** ********** and **** **********, as themselves, is an added bonus.<br /><br />It's hard to tell if *****'s performance is meant to insult or playfully tease *******, though I hardly think the Material Girl would find humor in it.<br /><br />My Favorite line: "Why don't you come here (to the Phillipines); all they eat is dog and I'm a vegetarian."
