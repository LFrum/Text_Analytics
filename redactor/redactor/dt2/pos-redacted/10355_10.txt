This film revolves around an Arabian leader (****) who dies and wants to live on. So a Dr. ***** ******* is being paid to transplant ***** brain into a "willing" participant. But in the Doctors basement his dwarf assistant ***** (****** ********) drains young girls blood for the doctors purposes. So meanwhile Doctor Llyod pays a man to kill the people who assisted **** into the country (***** is **** ******, ***** ********, and various unknown bodyguards.). ***** is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road. While this has happened the doctors other assistant *** is sent out to get a body for amir and hurts him so badly Dr.Llyod cant operate. Meanwhile, ***** finds ***** "girlfriend" ****** ****** and tells her his story. ***** sees the man who drove him off the road and ***** kills him. Then since *** failed to get a body D.r Llyod puts ***** brain into **** disfigured body. Then ***** and Regina go to the Doctors lab an<br /><br />------------------------SPOILERS------------------------- find out his secret. Soon **** (***) are prancing around killing people and in the muddle of what I think is plot Dr.Llyod has a brain-ray gun which hurts **** on command. It turns out Dr.Lloyd wants a country in which all scientists can work without law. So then Regina dies. and at the end ***** new body (I think) say that it shall be a new country blah blah.<br /><br />I still don't get the ending but overall this was a very enjoyable piece of smelly cheese.This film features ***** ******** in his second to last film roll. I recommend it for any fan of ** ******* or if you like Brains.
