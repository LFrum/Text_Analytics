***** ***** was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun-ho Bigot, making me hate him everytime he used the "N" word, I watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out. ( Just think, ***** ***** was a Monk once) (Now a supporting actor in "Everybody Loves *******") ***** ******** making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water. I noticed a large Raggerty Ann Doll(creator, **** *******) was the only thing that ***** could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes. If you really want to know about the way out 70's with drugs, free love and pipe dreams, then, enjoy the excellent direction of **** ** ******** ("***** and "The Karate Kid") I always thought that ***** ***** should have been blown away in the end!! This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.
