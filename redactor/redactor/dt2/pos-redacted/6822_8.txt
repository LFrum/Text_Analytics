There have been many people that have tried to make a movie that was identical to the story, ***** of Darkness. Some movies have been based on ***** of Darkness, like Apocalypse Now. In 1993, ******** **** directed a film that was exactly like the book. ***** of Darkness the movie is almost exactly identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. ***** of Darkness is about the journey of a seaman named ****** who sails along the Congo River to meet the super powerful ivory trader, ** * Kurz.<br /><br />***** of Darkness, the movie, has the same exact beginning and setting as the book. It takes place on a boat in the Thames River, and ****** is telling the story to four other men on a boat called the Nellie. The whole movie is a flashback of ******'s journey to see *** ***** on the Congo River. ****** works for the Belgian Company, which trades ivory along the Congo River. He tells of his account in the Company's office, and about all of the maps he saw in the office.<br /><br />****** sets out on a steamer to Africa. He arrives at the Central Station, where he receives orders from the general manager. The general manager tells ****** about *** ***** and the ivory trading ****** would be doing. ****** soon finds out that the general manager is not fond of ***** because he fears ***** will replace him. ****** waits around at the Central Station for months because his ship has been wrecked, and it is getting repaired. ****** sees the harsh treatment and enslavement in Africa while at the Central Station. When the ship has finally been repaired, ******, another African character named *****, and other crew members set sail on ******'s steamer for *** *****.<br /><br />Along the Congo River, they are attacked by African natives in the wilderness. As ******'s crew is attacked by the African natives, they end up shooting and killing *****. When ****** finally arrives at *****'s station, he meets a Russian who explains the might and glory of *****. ****** is then led to *****'s station home. There, he sees many maps and pictures that ***** has painted. Finally, ***** enters the room, and begins to tell ****** about all he has done in Africa and talks about his mistress. ****** soon finds out that ***** is insane with power because the Africans hail him as a god. ****** becomes angry with the harshness and enslavement that he sees in Africa. After ****** finally meets *****, ***** begins to die. While ***** was on his deathbed, he called ****** into his room. *****'s life begins to flash before his eyes, and his last words were "The horror, the horror." When ****** returns to Europe to see *****'s fianc√©, ****** tells her that *****'s last words were her name to hide the darkness in *****'s life.<br /><br />***** of Darkness was directed well and was formed into an adventurous movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery. The movie is slow at times, but in all, it really interesting. ***** of Darkness will really broaden your mind and will teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
