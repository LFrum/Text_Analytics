I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are **********, and *********. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really ********** because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out ********* though. Both had there strong points. For instance, they both had excellent well known casts, very good plots, and very good filming. But ***** beat out ********* in four ways in my opinion. First, the characters were more unique in *****. The music was better in *****. The idea was original in *****, unlike ***** ****. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! Oh my gosh! ***** was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast paced. Like modern day based shoot'em up movies. The action had big budget explosions too! The fistfights were pretty good also. ***** *** ******* was great in this movie! I suggest buying this excellent movie!
