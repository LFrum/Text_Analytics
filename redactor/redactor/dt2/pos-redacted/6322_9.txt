A variation of the same plot line was used in a ***** & ***** episode (Thin Air) that originally aired in Dec 1982.<br /><br />The gender of the victim was changed, the surviving spouse is one of ****'s "old flames". It's also interesting to note that ****** ******* had a role in this Rockford file episode. <br /><br />Both episodes were based on a story by ****** ****** - as noted in the list of 'writing credits'. <br /><br />******* ***** plays one of his classic TV bad guy roles.<br /><br />The continuation of the concept between the Rockford Files to ****** ** to ***** & ***** quite interesting.
