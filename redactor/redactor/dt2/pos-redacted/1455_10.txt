***** ******* did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best. If I had to name the best thing he ever did, though, it would be his performance as ******* *******, the heroin- addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved, just barely, by the love of a good woman (played by an exceptionally babelicious *** *****). The "cold-turkey" scenes between ******* and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. The movie is very nearly perfect, in fact, from **** ****'s title graphics to the ground-breaking jazz score by ***** *********. It might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s, but it's a must-see nevertheless.
