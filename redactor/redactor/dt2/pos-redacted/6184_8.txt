This film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, to the tune of "The Jolly Fat Policeman", they had a montage of scenes from the films to introduce the series of people laughing, including one of **** ****** chortling when watching a film in a movie house - a sequence from this film.<br /><br />It all begins innocently enough when ******, a millionaire, goes into a fancy department store in France to buy pajamas. But he only likes to sleep in the tops. The clerk (***** ******) insists that he cannot sell half a pair of pajamas as ****** wants. ********* ******* hears the argument and offers to help - she only likes to sleep in pajama bottoms. What if ****** sells them each half? ****** has never had such an offer before, so he goes to the floor walker (Rolfe Sedan) and asks him if this can be done. He is disturbed too - the request is quite unconventional. Eventually they contact the store's owner (******* ******). Halton is in bed, and gets out - his skinny frame supporting only a pajama top (if a suitably long one for the sake of censorship). Can they sell the two customers one set of pajamas (half for each)? Properly horrified, Halton answers, "No, of course not! That is Communism!!". So the sale is not allowed. Apparently nobody thinks that ****** can buy the total pair and sell half to *******.<br /><br />********'s BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE has had a reputation of falling flat, most viewers not liking it because of a misreading of *******'s character. She is seen as quite mercenary towards ****** - selling herself to him on her terms.<br /><br />Actually ******'s character is the nastier, as he is rich and figures that everything has a price. He is correct most of the time. Look at the way *******'s aristocratic pauper of a father, ****** ******* ******, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. ******'s willingness to marry ******* somehow includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or chooses to not marry her he has to pay damages. ******, when he realizes this, takes out a watch, and (in a most reassuring voice) says to ****** - "Take your time my boy!", to come to a decision. Later we see ******'s wardrobe has gotten more modern and fancier.<br /><br />The film, script by ***** ****** and ******* ********, compares well with their script for Mitchell Leisin's MIDNIGHT (also with *******, but with *** ****** and **** *********). There ******* is willing to sell herself for a money marriage to (to ******* *******), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage to Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver) but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married "for love" but poverty made them grow to hate each other. This is not found in BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, where ******* does not have a background like that (she is, after all, the daughter of a Marquis). Her mercenary plotting is to teach ****** a lesson about his standards.<br /><br />The film has some nice work by the supporting staff, including ****** **** as a private eye who turns out to be hiding things that ******* learns about, and a young ***** *****, who has a set of choice moments as a stand in punching bag and as a willing ear to ******. Coop tells Niven about his problems with *******, and how she is so infuriating. Niven listens respectfully. At the end, ****** is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say. "******, how much do I pay you?", ****** asks him. Niven thinks and says, "Thirty five francs a week sir.". ****** looks deeply into his soul, and says (shaking his head), "That's fair!"
