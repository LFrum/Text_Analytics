**** ***** is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that **** * is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever. Seriously. If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor, I would have thrashed ****** to within an inch of his life. No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid, both at the same time, except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with ******, I need a large glass of brandy. Never have I been so angry at a main character. Ok, having said that, **** * is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....and I'm talking graphic here, by the way. **** * will beat the hell out of you, though, so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it.
