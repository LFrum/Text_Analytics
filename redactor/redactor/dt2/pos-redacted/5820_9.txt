This light-heated (for ****avetes)love story is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by **** ******** and ******* *******. ******** was never more beautiful as a repressed, damaged mid-30's woman who meets her match in Seymour. ****ell is a powderkeg of energy and romantic notions (on his terms). <br /><br />There is a great supporting performance by *** ***** as ***** ***** and an unusual (as always) ******* ***** that's worth the price of admission. Made between ******** and A Woman Under the Influence this is ****' most accessible film that should touch the heart of anyone (especially the ****avetes haters) who claim his films are too long and ponderously heavy at times. Made my Top Ten that year and not seen by enough people. An 8 out of 10.
