I loved it. In fact, I watched it over and over and over, and I could watch it again. This movie doesn't get boring.<br /><br />The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a job well done, great for today's generation.<br /><br />****** ****** was born for this role. ******* ***** was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. ***** Logue provides great comical relief.<br /><br />This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.
