This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. <br /><br />******* fakes having ******** syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that ******* is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. ***** Hansen is planning on having ******* to be on Dateline to talk about ******** syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, ******* starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff. This was a funny episode about ******* faking ******** syndrome. I Recommend it to any South Park fan.
