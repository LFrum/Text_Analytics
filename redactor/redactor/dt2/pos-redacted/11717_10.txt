Without a doubt, the best **** ******** film ever! Even better than Smokey and the Bandit. This was probably the first real bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor, action, mystery and style that is missing in today's films.<br /><br />This one has it all: A psychotic ***** ***** jacked up on PCP, $1,000 a night call girls, ninja assassins and **** ******** getting his fingers sliced off, one by one, with a butterfly knife. The film is based on the novel by ******* ***** who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another one of my all-time favorites. This movie is worth watching just to see ***** ***** get shot six times, crash through a window, and fall thirty stories from the top of an Atlanta high-rise. This is probably the coolest stunt in Hollywood history, performed by legendary stuntman *** ********.<br /><br />******** also played "Moke" in the Elmore Leonard movie STICK, also starring **** ********. Stick features another great *** ******** stunt. ******** falls from a Miami apartment building and unloads all six shots from a .44 magnum on his way down. Very cool stuff.<br /><br />SHARKY'S MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this film flopped the way it did. If **** did more films like this, he would've built a better reputation for himself. He proves to be a talented director with ******, as well as a gifted actor. **** is supported by ***** *****, ******* *******, ****** *****, ******* *********, ****** ****, and everyone's favorite bad guy ***** *****. PLEASE remake this classic film! *** Affleck and ****** * * and some other hot actors and you've got a great movie just waiting to be filmed.<br /><br />I give it a 9 out of 10
