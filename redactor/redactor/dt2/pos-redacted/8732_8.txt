CACTUS FLOWER was a delightful 1969 comedy based on a Neil Simon play about a dentist (****** *******) having an affair with a young free spirited woman (****** ****), totally unaware that his devoted nurse/assistant(****** *******)is in love with him. Matthau can play this kind of role in his sleep and he doesn't disappoint as the philandering dentist, Dr. ****** *******, who is dating one woman but really has no clue that he's in love with another. ****** **** won an Oscar for her sparkling performance as **** *******, the aging flower child who slowly comes to realize she is trapped in a dead end affair and is not as dim as she appears on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of the legendary ****** ******* as ********* *********, Dr. *******'s completely devoted assistant, who is willing to to bury and sacrifice her own happiness as long as Dr. ******* is happy with ****. ******* is luminous in this film, looking absolutely beautiful (though the camera has always loved her) and showing an unforeseen knack for light comedy. Yes, the dialogue and the settings are slightly dated, but the story is timeless and the performances by the stars make it imminently watchable.
