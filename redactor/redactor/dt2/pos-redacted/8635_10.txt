I've loved this movie since I was a little kid. I remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me. I loved it and I still do. I think it's very funny and original. There are also some very catchy tunes in this movie. *** is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors that portray ****** ****** and Princess Eloise are okay too, but ****** and Costello are the best. Former heavyweight boxing sensation ***** ****, also brother of former heavyweight champion *** **** is good in this movie as the cop and The giant. He's a better actor than boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this movie is hilarious how *** ******** keeps crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with ***** ****. The slapstick in the house is good too. I especially like the comedy in the Giant's castle. My favorite parts are; the part were *** is climbing the beanstalk and they're all singing as a farewell. **** is singing back to them that he'll return. *** ******** is a very good at singing. My other favorite part is the part when **** is fighting with the Giant. I like when **** makes exploding eggs and when he tries to make the Giant an omelet they keep exploding. ****** and Costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time. This is only one of their great movies that I will love and cherish. The reviews for this movie aren't very good and I can't understand why. This is a very good ****** and Costello movie. I also love how *** ******** comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when *** hits him. He starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like no one is going to push me around. Very good movie.
