As the '70's drew to a close, rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean ******* to the role he had made famous back in 1962 - ***** ****.<br /><br />Cubby ******** was asked on location in Brazil during the making of 'Moonraker' by the B.B.C.'s ***** ****** how he viewed the prospect. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to commit himself to an opinion.<br /><br />When 'Moonraker' opened, **** fans were outraged by what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character, and the jumping onto the 'Star Wars' bandwagon much as 'Live & *** ***' had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier. Many publicly vocalised their hope that ******* would return, if only to show *** how a real **** movie should look.<br /><br />Years of legal battles followed. The original script, entitled '***** **** Of The Secret Service' ( later retitled 'Warhead' ) was written by ***** *******, *** ********, and *******, was never filmed, and remains one of the great unmade movie blockbusters.<br /><br />A new script, closer to the 'Thunderball' storyline, was commissioned. It was written by ******* ****** ******, best known as the man who put the camp into 'Batman'. He had also written 'The Parallax View', one of the decade's finest conspiracy thrillers. Feeling the script needed a British touch, ******* brought in Dick Clement and *** ** *******, writers of hit British sitcoms 'The ****** ****' and 'Porridge'. The witty title was suggested by *******'s wife *********. <br /><br />'Never *** ***** *****' opened just before Christmas 1983 to a shower of critical praise; normally sensible critics were so ecstatic at *******'s return they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many used it to viciously attack the ***** ***** series, particularly that year's 'Octopussy'. In truth, 'Octopussy' is superior in every respect. 'Never' lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with ****, at times it looks like a made-for-T.V. movie. The story had been done before and better in 1965's 'Thunderball', hence 'Never' was always going to come off second best. It was also hampered by not being part of the official series, meaning that ***** ******'s '***** **** *****' and Maurice Binder's gun-barrel logo could not be used. <br /><br />As ****, ******* is magnificent, effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role. Playing **** as an older, wiser agent worked. ******* ******* landed her best movie role as villainous 'Fatima Blush', a lady whose love for murder is such she dances after ( so she thinks ) killing ****. *** Basinger smolders as 'Domino'. As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent 'Maximillian *****', ***** ***** ********* gives a chilling performance. A major disappointment though is *** *** ***** as 'Blofeld'. The posters gave the impression he would be a major character, in fact he appears only in a few scenes. With a stronger script, he could have been one of the all-time great **** villains. <br /><br />'Never' promised to be a throwback to the early *** ****s such as 'From Russia With ****', but did not deliver. The gadgets were there, but were used almost apologetically. ****'s rocket-firing motorcycle was a tired gimmick even in the '60's. The film tried to compete with ***'s ****s in terms of humour. **** saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin's face is a farcical a moment as any you will find in 'Moonraker'. But the nadir comes with the introduction of ***** ******** as bumbling Foreign Office official 'Nigel Small-Fawcett'. He gives a performance so staggeringly awful you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights revue. <br /><br />****** *******'s music is horrible, the man seems to never to have seen a **** film in his life. <br /><br />Though the film was a financial success, viewed years later it stands as the weakest **** of the '80's. ******* himself was disappointed with it, and not did act in a movie again for some years.<br /><br />1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs, in addition to the ******* and Moore movies, ****** ******* did a delightful cameo in the made-for-T.V. 'Return Of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later ******'.
