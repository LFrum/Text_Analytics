Spoilers in this review! Despite a few highly improbable scenes, including the boys in PE measuring their penises in a contest and the few obligatory teens-trying-to-get-laid vignettes, this movie captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teen films have ever done. It achieves this by not only showing the trio of friends, ****, ****, ****, as smoking, drinking, ever on the prowl teens, but also dwells on the nature of friendship itself as these three friends have their loyalties tested. This film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends. For the shy romantic ****, when he sees the lovely ***** for the first time he falls instantly in love. The awakening emotion in **** is writ large on the screen, and he proves his love for her by taking her in when she is jilted by her lover. This love for ***** signals the end of ****'s innocence, as the bonds with his two best friends will be tested, and broken, over the course of the story. The confident ladies man, ****, is the person in high school we all secretly wish we were: handsome, cool, and always has the impossibly beautiful girls in a swoon. **** turns out to be a cad, but you have to bear in mind that his character is only 17 years old. He panics and makes a bad decision. From ****'s perspective, the story is also about finding the one girl of his dreams, a bad breakup, and then at the end reconciling. The look on ****'s face as **** walks in and sees ***** kissing ****, shows that he at last understands that his best friend and he love the same woman. As in real life, you don't bow out because your friend has an unrequited love. This is the tragedy of the film. **** is no villain, and constantly through the film he reminds **** and **** that they're his best friends. The soulful quality of ****'s performance, however, is the heart of the story. ******** ******* is a beautiful loser. He does everything right, his heart's in the right place, and he's consumed by love for *****. Yet, *****, in the end, is not moved by ****'s devotion and kindness. ***** represents all the people in the world who take in without giving back, who exist in a vacuum of their own ego and never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others. This film is brutal in its statements on love and friendship, but that's what makes it unique among teen films. It ceases being a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film, albeit one doomed to a tragic conclusion. Anyone who has ever found the girl of his dreams and did not win her, will understand. The heartrending crushes of high school are every bit as real as the emotional strains of adulthood, and this film will remind you of that in bold strokes. ****'s final reversal, as he drives away with the inscribed locket, is as poignant a moment as any in cinema. One feels, after watching this, that it's really made of two movies. The first part is a silly teen sexploitation film, and once the story begins, it's a strongly affecting drama. A terrific movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in its selection of many rising stars including The Police, The Cars, Devo, ***** ******, The Plimsouls, The Waitresses, ******** ******, and **** *******.
