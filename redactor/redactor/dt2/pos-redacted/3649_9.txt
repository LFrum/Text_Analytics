This is one of those ****** and Sylvester cartoons that made this legendary pair second only to **** ***** in terms of ****** ***** popularity.<br /><br />Besides having all of the stock situations for this duo (Sylvester feeding out of garbage cans, the "I tawt I taw a putty tat" line, etc.), ******'s S.O.S also stars ******, who is one of those types of supporting characters that these Warner Bros. classics had in abundance to enrich the color and flavor of them. This time out the cat and bird are aboard an ocean liner and the gags that are extracted from this situation are creative and lively.<br /><br />What a day that was in cartoon history when **** ******* decided to pair his Sylvester with the departed ****** ********'s little yellow bird.
