Hanks, *******, ******* in a Oscar nominated performance and *** ***** as *******'s loyal assistant are very good in their roles. Despite the excellent true-life premise, "******* ******'s War" never really catches fire and it is not as wickedly funny as you liked it to be. ******** ******* and Screenwriter:***** ****** (A Few Good Men) keeps things moving and the characters are well liked throughout.<br /><br />DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good ***** ******* 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only special features are the behind the scenes featurette with the cast & crew and a real-life featurette with ******* ****** and Others. "******* ******'s War" is a good movie that could have been really great but it's not. But this movie is smart enough to please for those, who enjoyed well written or well acted adult comedies. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
