I saw this at the 2008 Palm ******* ************* **** ********. There are some wonderful descriptions of this film from other commenter's here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so I won't too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of ***** ***** and maybe a little of Federico Fellini in this film's collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real singular plot. A few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call. The beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that bookends the film. It took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the plainest and homeliest looking people in all of ****** to make the cast. This is ******'s official submission for **** ******* ******** **** for the 2007 ******* ******. It's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official submission for best foreign film. Last year ******'s official submission was the very weak ****** ********** and the year before it was expensive looking but dull ZoZo, so once again ****** will have no chance in picking up the Oscar. This film has it's moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film. *** ********* directs. ****** Danielsson is the cinematographer. ****** **** ***** ***** deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this. ***** ********* of ABBA fame provides an entertaining music score. It's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and I did like it but It's nothing really special and could only give it a 7.0 out of 10.
