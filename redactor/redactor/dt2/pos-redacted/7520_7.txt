I had never paid much attention to this flick until I learned that ***** ********* - author of the brilliant "*******" - was the scriptwriter. His work there had instructed me as to his genius, so when 'Hospital' appeared on TMC, I was anxious to see it. I was not disappointed. Looking at both this film and "*******" it would seem that his big theme is the absurdity, inanity, and sheer viciousness of large human enterprises (e.g., hospitals, networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and the human spirit, and all of it delivered with a knife-edge sense of utterly black humor. "Hospital" is as black of a comedy as "*******" is, and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable *****, does his work full justice. This is a keeper; definitely not to miss.
