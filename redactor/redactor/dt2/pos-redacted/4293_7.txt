Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director ****** ********. Outstanding performance, as usual, by *** ********* but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors ***** ******* and **** *******. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'. A good tight production at around only 80 minutes, probably produced on a very limited budget, but a success, which should see ******** directing again for the big screen. Some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the 50s (as per ***** *******'s novel)but obviously this is not the case. Recommended viewing.
