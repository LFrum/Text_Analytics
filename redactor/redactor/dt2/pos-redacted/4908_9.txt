Directed by ******* ******, **** ********* is about four musically gifted sisters, their suitors, and their father, a minor conductor.Playing sardonic, quick talking ****** ****** is **** ******** in the role that made him an instant star.The movie also stars ****** ***** as **** **** and the Lane sisters, ****, ********, and *********, and **** **** as his spirited daughters.Its definitive scene takes place in the Lemps' living room. ********* hanging from his lips, ****** is playing one of his own compositions. ********* Lane's *** **** tells him the piece is beautiful. But he says, "It stinks." He continues: "It hasn't got a beginning or an end, only a middle." *** urges him to create a beginning and an end. ****** replies, "What for? The fates are against me. They tossed a coin--heads I'm poor, tails I'm rich. But they tossed a two-headed coin." Audiences loved the way ********, in his tough city voice, said It stinks. That scene created ********'s screen persona as the eternal outsider. **** ********* is a slice of Americana with ********, in a compelling performance, supplying more than a hint of darkness.<br /><br />
