This is ***** ***** at his best. If only all the films he made after were like this.<br /><br />This extraordinary film is as intriguing as ***** Argento´s "The bird with crystal plumage"... <br /><br />If you´re an Argento fan but you don´t like ***** ***** films, like<br /><br />"The Beyond", "********* ****", "The House by the Cemetery", etc. this one has nothing to do with the others... this is what the Italians call "giallo"... that would be something like a "who-done-it" movie in a nutshell.<br /><br />You won´t know who the killer is until the last moments of the film.<br /><br />But apart from that, there´s the plot: some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys... A journalist (***** ******), a sexy young woman (******* *******), a priest (**** *****), his mother (***** *****) and a witch (******** ******) are the main characters in this tangled, bloody story.<br /><br />Talking about the actors, I want to say that ***** ****** is superb (like always), and ******** ****** is terrific as the village witch...<br /><br />Do you want to know who is the killer?... <br /><br />I cannot tell you... but I can tell you that you must see this film!.<br /><br />(10 out of 10)... of course!
