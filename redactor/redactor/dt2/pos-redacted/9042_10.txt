This is easily the best cinematic version of ******* ********'s fiction that I've ever seen, and I've seen several of the most prominent ones. Filmed in ********'s hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, it really captures the feeling of ********* and ************* ******. Intruder in the Dust is not one of ********'s best novel, but, even if it is a clich√© to say this, it would be the crown jewel in any one else's career. It beats ****** ***'s good but simplistic To Kill a Mockingbird fifty feet into the ground (I read that one in ninth grade, and that's exactly where it belongs). Two of ********'s most prominent characters play major parts in the film, ***** ******* and ***** *********. ******* is probably the single most common character in all of ********'s fiction. He's a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because, unlike many of his other characters, ******* is a man of logic, not emotion (at least when he's older). ***** ********* may be the most prominent of all of ********'s black characters (he plays a major part in one of ********'s out-and-out masterpieces, ** ****, Moses); unlike all of the other black folks in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow down to any white man. He has pride, and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man. One day, ***** is found standing over a dead white man with a recently-fired pistol in his possession. Most of ********* and the surrounding areas don't see the need for a trial, and everyone's pretty sure that ********* will be lynched before the evening's over, or at least the next day, as the murder and arrest occurred on a Sunday. *********, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to get ******* to help him. ******* refuses; the case seems open and shut. But his young nephew, ***** ********, because ***** had helped him in the past, is willing to help him now.<br /><br />As far as I know, no Hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one. Hollywood films rarely persecute the black population, but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles. If you're an African American actor, you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy, the maid, the servant, or the porter, because that's the only way you'll work. In Intruder in the Dust, there is to be found one of the most memorable non-porter roles a black actor ever had, ***** *********. And *********, as I described above, is no stereotypical character, and might have been hard for audiences to accept. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical, and kind. The recent arthouse hit *** from Heaven is a great example of that. ********* is kind of a jerk, and he's very stubborn. Although he's perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel, he's not any kind of stereotype. He's a complex human being. ***** ********* plays ********* extraordinarily well. I haven't seen the film in a while, but he also appears in ****** *******'s 1955 film, **** ** ******, as well as the cinematic adaptation of ********'s final novel, The Reivers.<br /><br />All the actors are great in the film. I should also praise quickly ****** ****** ** *, who has the great role of ***** ********. The novel takes place from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the picture. Jarman is quite an actor; he captures the character (who also appears elsewhere in ********'s fiction, narrating, for example, events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town) perfectly. He would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated **** **** film *** ******. The only other film of Clarence Brown's that I've seen is National Velvet, quite a different picture than Intruder in the Dust. His job here is exceptional; I really have to credit him with capturing ******** perfectly. Other famous ******** adaptations are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, which I really like despite that) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which I do not like; that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of ********). The only other one that really does well according to its source material is ******* ****'s great 1958 filming of Pylon (really a different sort of ******** novel altogether), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
