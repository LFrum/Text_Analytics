...this film noire set piece suffers from murky sound (at least, as shown on the inadequate equipment of both the Seattle and Maine film festivals) and murkier plotting, while ******* suffers from an American accent, old tennis shoes and baggy sweats. Nonetheless, he has moments of stellar scenery chewing, and the film offers sinister ambiguity from Norman Reedus, the pretty ***** ******, and a surprise ending (telescoped to frequent filmgoers), while affording a beautiful look at the physiography of both Maine and *******. Due out in video release (after a cable airing) in March. Not to be missed by any ******* fan. Ignore the amanita hooey.
