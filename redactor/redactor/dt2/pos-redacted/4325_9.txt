Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.<br /><br />Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives ***** the way to become a Torturer, ** ****** *****, playing a character named *** *****. In the last episode, he is playing ****** *****, the ******* partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh? Yeah Right!<br /><br />I guess that all of us will have to wait, to see what's next in the life of the wonder people in that strange island, in the middle of nowhere. Knowing that several of my favorites characters, *******, ***** and *** ***, have an unclear destiny<br /><br />I believe that along with 24 and The Shield, this is one of the best TV shows ever, of course, keeping **** ***** at a special place.
