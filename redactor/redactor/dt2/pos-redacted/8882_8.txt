This movie is basically a spoof on *********'s Strangers on a train, which i thought was overrated anyway. The plot has ***** ****** going to see Strangers and then thinking ***** ******* wants them to swap murders, For Crystal to murder his mother and ****** to murder his wife. Both ****** and Crystal are great and so is ******'s mother. This is ******'s directorial debut and it's better than the war of the roses.
