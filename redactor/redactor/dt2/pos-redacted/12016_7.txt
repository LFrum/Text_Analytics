Ex-reporter ***** **** (**** *******) is hired by an acquaintance (******* ** *****) to find his ex-wife and son. Asch heads to Palm Springs and quickly locates the ex ***** (Beverly D'Angelo) with someone he believes to be the son (a young ****** ****). But things turn out to be a bit more complicated as Asch discovers former white trash ***** has definitely married up in the form of millionaire ***** ********* (*** ******) and her first son is nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />Director/writer ******* ******* is channeling BODY HEAT here and this mid-80s neo-noir is watchable enough thanks to an all-star cast and nice locations. D'Angelo was still looking good around this time, so she makes for a good femme fatale and isn't afraid to show some skin. However, the mystery isn't very compelling in the end. Co-starring ****** ********, ***** ********** and ***** ******. ******* made several thrillers in the 80s, but his "biggest" career achievement was co-authoring the screenplay for the infamous COLOR OF NIGHT.
