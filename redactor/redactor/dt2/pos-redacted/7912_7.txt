Evocatively directed and slickly photographed psychological mystery thriller with an exceptional lead performance by a sombre ****** **********, and potent support roles from ****** ********* and ***** *******. The material decides to keep it all glum, and moves from the investigation period into the back-story of the victim. The seldom, and quite sullen nature of investigation pulled me in, but when it flashback to the victim's side showing her final days weren't as compelling, and became somewhat stodgy and stock-like. While the script is strongly detailed and to a certain degree complex in stringing us along, however the final and surprising revelation should have been more bone-jarring and it's not helped out by its sloppy execution. ****** *****'s music score has an emotional sting to its cues that simply linger, and director ****** *******'s capable handling (well for most part) has a strong stylistic and tight manner, which gets the best out of moody locations and flexible cast. The young faces **** ******** and **** ****** do an incredibly good job as well.
