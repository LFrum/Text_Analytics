*** G Indahouse has got to be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and *****'s portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious. This film has cult classic written all over it, and it features some really great lines. *** G Indahouse is a good-time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. Definitely **** *** * and keep it real.
