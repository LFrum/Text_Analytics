The ********* is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than *******'s Romeo&****** or *********'s Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. *** is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for ****** *****. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and ***. And I wish that it ends soon... ********* tells although my life, I deeply identify with the story and the characters. Thanks at least for **** ********* ******** and the director.
