I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. *** Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. **** ***** is perfect for the role of ***** ****. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little **** and **** to **** ****** and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it!!<br /><br />If you liked **** ***** in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.
