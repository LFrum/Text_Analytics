I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clich√©d topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.<br /><br />Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.<br /><br />The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. ****** Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, "just right" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...<br /><br />I have a renewed respect for ******* *** ******, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi. She beats expectation yet again after Page-3 and ** *& Mrs.Iyer. Prof. ******'s role is very well developed and ******* does full justice to the character. ***** Bose, ******* *****, ******* ****** add incredible flavor to the movie.<br /><br />I define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly, till your wife/girlfriend/mom bangs at the door. 15PA delivers many "shower moments" especially the conversation between ****** and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to ****** about her thoughts. It immediately brings out ******'s personality to the audience.<br /><br />The end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too westernized for the Indian audience; yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a "good" to a "great" status.
