This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s. **** Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. ***** Sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by ***** ********* is dynamite. From the opening titles (by **** ****) to the hysteria of drug addict ***** going cold turkey, this is a riveting movie! With *** ***** (giving a very good performance), ******* ****** (giving a very bad performance) as well as ****** ******* as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as *****'s grifter pal. Beware of bad prints: this movie is in the public domain so some copies are pretty rough.
