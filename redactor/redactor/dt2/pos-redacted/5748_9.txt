This movie was amazing. I was in tears by the end of the movie. Okay, I know the acting sucked but that's not what was important. The message came through loud and clear about ***'s love for us and *****'s sacrifice. The movie was realistic and showed actual human feelings whether it be ****'s anger of the blond girl's sneers or the guy that asked questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with ******. The cars were awesome and the actors were very hot and that attracted my eye. But what I liked most about this movie was the clear Gospel message. The mother and pastor supported *** in his new walk with ****** and tried to be a godly example to others. ***** * showed that no matter if you have all the world has to offer, without ******, it doesn't matter. Nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the mark. I loved this movie and think that it will bring many teenagers to ******.
