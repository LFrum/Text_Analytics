Based on the 1952 autobiography "A Many-Splendoured Thing," "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" (1955) tells the story of *** *****, focusing on the romance that ***, a widowed Eurasian doctor in 1949 Hong Kong, had with a married American correspondent named **** *******. "I don't want to feel anything again, ever," *** tells **** soon after they meet, but the two soon develop the mutual irresistibles for each other, and who can blame them? **** is played by ******* ****** at the near peak of his hunky-dude period (the following year's "Picnic" would be the peak) in this, the first of three films over the next seven years that would find ****** in China (1960's "The World of ***** ****" and 1962's "***** ***** ******" being the others). And Dr. *** is here played by ******** *****, who, although not a Eurasian (unlike yummy ***** **** and pretty France Nuyen of those other exotic ****** films), does a credible job of passing as one. ******* dressed in cheongsam, European frock, surgical gown or (hubba-hubba!) bathing suit, ***** looks ridiculously gorgeous here. No wonder East meets West in this film so dramatically! With its two appealing lead stars, breathtaking Hong Kong scenery, beautiful CinemaScope and color, Oscar-winning costumes and that classic, Oscar-winning title song that wafts through the film like a lovely incense, "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" turns out to be quite the winning and romantic concoction. *** herself supposedly did not care for the picture, so I can only imagine that great liberties were taken with her source material. Still, I enjoyed it. And if the film's ending causes a tear to come to the eye, just remember ****'s words of wisdom: "****'s greatest tragedy is not to be loved."
