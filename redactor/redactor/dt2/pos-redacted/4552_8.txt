Well, on the day that *** ********* plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not-at-all-wanted "***** *******: ******** ******" (hmmmm....wasn't there a film called ******** which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there's ***** *******: **** ****** followed by sequel ***** *******: ******** ******.......I smell a pattern. Perhaps soon there will be *********: European webs are ******.....or not) I am writing about this much maligned (at time of release) film. I was one of those maligners, I must admit. I turned my nose up at it even while ***** ****** shoved cocaine up his nose and the SNL cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in '94-'95, the Norm McDonald anchorship notwithstanding. Films like ***** *******, ***** ***, and ***** ***** came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of *****-******-Schneider-Sandler films. However I watched this film the other day, ten years after and 8 years after ***** died and could not stop laughing. Yes it's not particularly sophisticated. ****** does what ****** does (not unlike Manny being Manny) but his "*** **** By the River" motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not "wash enough" or "wear well-fitting clothes" or "use deodorant more than twice a week" translates well here as the ever self-effacing character who realizes he's not the brightest, not the best-looking, and could stand to lose a few pounds. All the same, he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to. And ***** ***** just tosses off his snide one-liners as he did for "*****'s ********* ******" and basically stings ******'s self-esteem. There's really not a whole lot more to say than that. I love the one scene when ****** catches ***** spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it. Can't remember what the first one is but the second one, they're lying in their hotel beds and ****** says to *****, "Do you like baseball?". ***** mutters something inaudible in response and ******* says, "the New York YANK-ees?" Anyway ****** does his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. If you like, you like it. I couldn't stop laughing.
