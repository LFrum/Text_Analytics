Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When **** tells ***** that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of ****** *** and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! ***** does it in her typical ***** ******* style. ********* Pryce is excellent as ******. ***** is one of ***** *****' best roles. ******** ***** steals just about every scene that she is in. ****** ******* does some of his finest work in Unconditional as ****. The Kiss between ****** and ******** took me to another bout of hysterics. In this day and age of Gay rights being questioned, I think this movie should be seen by all. As a gay Man in my late 40's I have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies. So kudo's to all involved in the making of this film.
