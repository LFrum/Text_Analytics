I have reasons to love the great users of a camera; fluid direction of action lends itself to fast-paced adventure and comedy narrative; but such a skill, in the hands of a King Vidor or an ******* **** can also be applied to idea-level work. This is **** *******' masterpiece. Its storyline can be retailed in a single pair of sentences. General ****** ******* is setting up as near-emperor in Northern Mexico, and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his crack mission unit, divided, apprehensive but determined, led by ****** *******, to get the cannon back and bring back ******* alive, to put an end to the rebellion. Charismatic *** ******* plays *******; the ladies in the piece are ******** ***** and Francine York; with the squad even further comprised of **** ********, ***** *****, and *** ******. Other stalwarts in the class include **** ***** and **** *******. Also horning in on an already fantastically-dangerous operation are **** *****, and a stubborn Mexican Teniente (******** *****) whose regiment was betrayed when ******* set up on his own. The danger is multiplied when ******'s brother as advance spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch...and he decides he needs to kill *******. The attack that captures the cannon, when *******'s orders are not obeyed by a regular army type, is one of the most electrifying visual and staging achievements in cinematic history; the penetration of *******'s stronghold, the revelations uncovered there, and the actions that win the mission team a chance at victory--or almost victory--are flawlessly presented. This is a beautiful color adventure film, with unusually strong costumes, acting, lighting, art direction sets and music by ***** *********. The script by ******* ****** is probably his best ever for a feature film. This is probably the most underrated major western at the moment, but I have always appreciated its heroes as result- getting hard-workers. But as ******* reminds his group on the way home, "The trouble with being a "hero"--is the morning after". To find out why he says so, you will have to see "Cannon For *******".
