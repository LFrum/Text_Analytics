They were alternative before there was alternative, The Residents are a band like no other, and I love them for it. This has all their classics, from 'Hello ******', 'Third Reich and ****' to their homage to the great ***** ***** with a take on 'This is a ***'s ***'s ***'s World'. But that is just the beginning. As a bonus it even has ******* & the Loafs hauntingly beautiful 'Songs for Swinging ******' and even features The Residents cover of it. Needless to say, I highly recommend the purchase of this DVD, I would also recommend buying their latest album 'Demons ***** *****', it is fantastic.<br /><br />Uncle ****** ******* ***** #502
