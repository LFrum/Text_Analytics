I was very impressed with what ***** ****** was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me. I say this because I know this independent film had a limited budget/resources, but despite this, it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of work.<br /><br />Enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which I can't help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come, ***** ****** didn't fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing. It's a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guard.<br /><br />Many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future. ******* told me that **** ****** recently passed, and if this is true it's a real tragedy since his stoic performance in ***** ****** is remarkable.<br /><br />Kudos to **** ********* who has truly pulled out a winner with this one!
