This is another of ****** ******'s underrated films(let's be honest, the only movie he's made that really didn't work was ***** to Wear), and ***** ****** gives a spellbinding performance in it.She is far better here than she was in "The Out of Towners". The material, I will admit, is beneath the great director ****** and the extraordinary actress ******, but that hardly matters anyway.As long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well, just about any story will do.
