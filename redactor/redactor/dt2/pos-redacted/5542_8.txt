What happened to *** ******* in the 1940s and ******* ****** in the '50s also seemed to take place for modern-day actress ******** ******** in the '80s: Her remarkable good looks got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished, superbly talented actress. Anyone looking for validation of Pfeiffer's dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991's "******* and ******" or '92's "**** *****" (a personal favorite of mine); those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be, when given the right part, should check out 1988's "******* to the Mob." In this one, she plays ****** *******, the widow of a recently "iced" Mob hit-man, who moves from her garishly tacky Long Island home to start a new life for herself and her son, while being pursued by Mob boss **** ********* and FBI man ******* ******. While this movie has lots going for it (a very amusing script; offbeat characters; sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence, as in director ******** *****'s previous effort "Something Wild"; and hilarious yet menacing performances by Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl, as his jealous wife from hell), ******** steals the show easily. Notice how perfectly she nails ******'s undereducated, Long Island Italian accent, and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character. Once upon a time, long ago, ****** were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one. Had this film been made 60 years ago, ******** mighta been a contenduh...
