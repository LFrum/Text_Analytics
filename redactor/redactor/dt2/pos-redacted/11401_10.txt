**** ****** ********'s stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows ***** *****, aka **** ******* (**** ********), through six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance meeting with pornography director **** ****** (**** ********) starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. ****'s character is based on real-life porn actor **** ******, who, like ****, was renowned for being extremely "well-endowed". This is where **** finds initial success.<br /><br />The main themes in ****** ****** are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. ****** ****** deals with the pornography theme with some control. It is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they take place on screen.<br /><br />Throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously, and the film's setting, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at that time, which the film captures perfectly. However, ****** ****** does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses. For example at Jack's party, they find a girl who has recently, and graphically, overdosed; blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit. The film, before this scenes, has been fairly upbeat and comic, but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occur.<br /><br />The music scenes are executed brilliantly, from superbly-staged disco scenes to a down-and-out **** singing terribly in his new music career. The soundtrack too is excellent, featuring tunes from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable ***** **********. The standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music; ****, **** ********* (**** ** ******) and **** ****** (****** ****) visit drug dealer ***** *******'s (****** ******) house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs, but ***** ******'s ****** *********, which is playing in the background, increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. ****** ****** is filled with those kind of scenes, which makes the film even more fantastic.<br /><br />The standout performance in ****** ****** is **** ******** as the enigmatic, yet moody, film director. In the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies, it is a complete shock for the audience, because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content. Other notable performances are ******** *****, ******* ****** as the beautiful Rollergirl, **** ** ******, and **** ********, who delivers the performance of his career.<br /><br />****** ****** is also a surprisingly original film, using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. ********'s approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong, or at least until the 80s arrive. From then on, things turn very dark indeed, and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone. This does not, however, reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers.<br /><br />****** ****** was not a box-office success, earning only Â£2 million at cinemas in the UK. But this is not the film's, or the director's concern. ******** recognises quality, not popularity, which is evident in his three other films, **** *****, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film you will realize that ****** ****** is a simple morality tale, but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it. ****** ****** is at once shocking, hilarious, devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding.
