This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever. I have heard the Merman cast album, the Angela Lansbury album, I have seen **** **** live, and I've seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think ***** is if not the best, then tied with the best. She captures not just the bravura, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I was never a Natalie Wood fan, so I really enjoyed ******* ****, in what is arguably her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the always-dependable ********* ******** are hard to top. There was supposed to be a TV production of Mame a few years back, with ****, but I think ***** would be the best bet (pun intended) for ****** ****.
