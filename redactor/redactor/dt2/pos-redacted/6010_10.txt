This film is wonderful example of the quality dramas that Channel 4 and the BBC have produced over the years. *** ****** delivers a powerful performance of a man tormented by memories noone will accept, and a society that believes he is insane. It is a remarkable performance by a man most known for his role in Cheers, a TV comedy sitcom. The supporting cast are all very well chosen, not least Mary Steenbergen, ******'s wife, who acts the part of ********'s wife in the film. But above all it is the seamless and very delicate shifts between our world and ********'s world that make this film. The difference in perspective between giants and midgets, all acted by real actors is beautifully captured. A rare treat of cinematography and direction.
