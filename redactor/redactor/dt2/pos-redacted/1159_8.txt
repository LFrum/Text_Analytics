Writer/director **** ****** takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. The result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable, larger-than-life roles: **** ******* as the wily **** sheik with an inexplicable Scottish brogue, and ***** ***** as President Theodore Roosevelt, itching for the chance to put that "big stick" to good use.<br /><br />Aided immeasurably by ***** ********' glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable ***** *********, this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries *****, ******* and *********. Although ****** served up tantalizing glimpses of his ability in scripts for JEREMIAH JOHNSON and APOCALYPSE NOW, his career seemed to take a downward turn not long after he started directing, ultimately foundering on dreck like CONAN THE BARBARIAN and RED DAWN. <br /><br />Here's hoping that he will again find his way.
