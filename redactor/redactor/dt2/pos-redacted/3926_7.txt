**1/2 ****** ********, **** ******* ******, ***** *** ****, ***** ****** and *** ********. Directed by ***** Collet-*****.<br /><br />Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like **** ******'s 1974 classic ***** ******** ******** later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture. ******** ***** showed mild enthusiasm with his directing but still worth watching. My final rating 7/10.
