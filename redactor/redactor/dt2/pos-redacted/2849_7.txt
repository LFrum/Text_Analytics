***** ********* absolutely shines as ***** *****, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.<br /><br />When soap opera obsessed waitress ***** ******** witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan ******* and ***** ****), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. ***** ****** (a character on the show).<br /><br />As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating ******* generate some very fun chemistry, and **** ******* also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona. ***** ********* turns in an innocent, candy-coated, and sometimes terribly sweet performance as ***** *****. She exudes goodness, warmth, and is irresistible. While the script sometimes feels like a sit-com, is filled with sometimes unbelievable characters and contrived situations, ********* is so likeable and so utterly disarming that it all comes together.<br /><br />With just a few splashes of black comedy to keep things interesting, a winning performance from *********, a great supporting cast and a competent script, ***** ***** is utterly delightful.<br /><br />7 out of 10
