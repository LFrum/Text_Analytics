This is without a doubt one of **** *****'s best plays turned movies. It's full of great characters, and memorable dialog. ********* ********* makes a great screen version of young Eugene(he was played by ******* ********* on stage).This is the first of *****'s autobiographical trilogy, its followed by the wonderful "****** *****", and closes with the TV movie "******** *****". If I had to say the movie has any flaws it would maybe be that characters sometimes usually speak in obvious dialog, but that's alright because it's great dialog. Rent this little gem, you won't be sorry!
