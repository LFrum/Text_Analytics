Having obtained a copy of Bostocks Cup I must confess It is not as funny as I originally thought!! IT IS BETTER!!!!! ******* ******** ... eat your heart out. Match fixing???? Never! Sloping pitch at 45%? Ronnie and ****** ***? ****** Best? The Coach Driver who thinks ********** is in South Wales ( It's all ***** this and ***** that)****** ******'s (*** ******'s)lucky Cup hat!! (not that he's into gimmicks) ***** **** *****????? Confused???? Watch it again. The innovative use of real footage with Bostock players was brilliant and the producer should be proud of giving us a MASTERPIECE. Come on ITV do the viewers and yourself a favour - show it again!!!
