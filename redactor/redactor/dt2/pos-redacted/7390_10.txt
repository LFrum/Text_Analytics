"It's funny your worst nightmare always seems so far away!" <br /><br />**** ******'s characters, a married couple (**** ******* & ***** ******) and a vagabond (Norman Reedus), are slipping into a game full of hidden sexual energy and treason. Now-and-then tantalizing breaks increase the tensions and give much space for interpretations. Good acting and a story which, if not using the brain, will leave you in confusion. You have to watch it twice at least. The very strength lies in its unconventionality and in **** *******, of course. Those who love him will love this movie.<br /><br />Conclusion: It is not a typical prime time movie but **** **** !
