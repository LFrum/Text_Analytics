Set in Paris in the year 1910, a retired old rich opera singer decides to give her fortune away to her beautiful cat Duchess ( voiced by *** *****) and her kittens, but the jealous butler ***** comes up with a plan as he kidnaps the cats and leaves them in the countryside. Luckily for them with the help of a streetwise and independent tomcat named ****** ******** ( voiced by **** ******) helps them get home especially meeting some of his good friends like the swinging' **** *** ( voiced by Scatman Crothers) and try to foil *****'s plans.<br /><br />Very entertaining and edgy post-Walt ******'s death animated movie with a couple of nice jazzy tunes like the memorable "Everybody wants to be a cat", good voice acting and some terrific animation for it's time even in these times of computer animation. Not one of the greatest ****** animated movies but a cult ****** animated fave and one of the few gems of it's day that works well, highly recommended.
