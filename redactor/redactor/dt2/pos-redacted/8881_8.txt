A picture starring ***** ****** and ***** *******. They are both famous actors, and in this charming comedy entails them trying to murder each other's pet peeve. ***** *******'s pet peeve being his ex wife who stole his book and put her name on it, and ***** ******'s pet peeve being his malignant mother. ***** ******* is an author and a teacher apparently and ***** ****** is one of his students. This comedy classic is very entertaining and for all ages.<br /><br />***** ****** seems to act like a child in this movie because of his evil mother who keeps putting him down all the time. She says things like "You have no friends!" and when ***** ******* fell down, she said "***** him before he stinks up the basement!". She puts down ***** also by calling him "**** ass!" and other things just to make him angry.
