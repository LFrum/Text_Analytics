*******, ******* is a stunning and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders **** and *****. ***** Tunney gives a fantastic performance as ***** suffering from ********'s *******, getting sicker and sicker as the movie progresses. This movie is not very optimistic and it's very hard emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. It's definitely worth it.
