Nostalgia isn't always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult. While there are exceptions to this rule, it's hard to justify owning a DVD of Krull, regardless of how many insightful the director's commentary may be. But stay sharp Gen X/Y'ers, because the dozens of disappointments dominating your trip down memory lane, might stop you from stumbling across one worth revisiting.<br /><br />One surprise film worth another look is **** **********'s **********, the supernatural thriller starring 80's popcorn heavyweights ****** **********, ***** *****, ***** ******* and ***** *******. You would think that a stew comprised of this cast, the flamboyant flair of ********** and the Ã¼ber slick eye of cinematographer *** ** **** would result in something sickeningly stodgy, but calories aside... ********** ain't half bad. Even though it's production design is inexplicably over-the-top and the photography is achingly over- stylized (replete with neon soaked streets spewing endless billows of steam), ********** still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller. If there's an explanation why ********** was forgotten, it might be because 1990 saw the release of another, far superior, supernatural thriller: *****'s ******.<br /><br />Had ********** been released a year or two after *****'s ******, it's likely **********'s flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a toned down, commercialized rip-off of Adrian Lyne's nightmarish masterpiece. But with these films being released in the same year, ********** enjoyed a different fate, tripling JL's take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise. The passage of time hasn't been as kind to **********, it has been lost atop a dated heap of throwaway 80's **** **** dreck, while JL has cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. Fates aside, JL is seamlessly terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame, whereas ********** falls victim to over- simplification and Hollywood conveniences that drag down the final act into a predictably tidy denouement. Comparisons between the two movies is unfair, and ultimately overlooks ********** ability to represent the 80's at its quintessential best. Released at the end of a decade of shallow excess, ********** will always be dated by its hairstyles and clothing styles, but in fairness, it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at (or at least near) the top of its particular heap of dreck. For intents and purposes, it's an entertaining walk down memory lane.
