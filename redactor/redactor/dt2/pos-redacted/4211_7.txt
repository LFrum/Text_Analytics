They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of ***** ***** which starred ******* *********, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.<br /><br />Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. ******* *********, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. **** ******** with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.<br /><br />They Made Me a Criminal was directed by ***** ******** who **** ****** believed in keeping busy in between musicals. ******** in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM. <br /><br />******** does do a fine job here, keeping the action flowing at a good pace. I particularly like the scene where four of the Dead End **** and ******** are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down. They get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity.<br /><br />Other performances besides ******** and the kids to remember are May ****** who runs the summer camp for the kids and ****** ***** as the obsessed detective on ********'s trail.
