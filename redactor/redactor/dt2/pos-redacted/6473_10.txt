Some time ago, we read of the results of a poll taken by some Newspaper Sports Writers. The Questions posed were only two, and were brief and right to the point.<br /><br />The Question Number 1 asked respondent to tell who was his most Beloved college football team. Question Number 2 asked the fan to name his most Hated college football team. The answer to both questions was simply, ***** ****! ND is tops on both lists! Yeah, love 'em or hate 'em, but you sure don't ignore ,em.<br /><br />The roots of this unique position of this Indepent* ******* ******** ********** are found in the life and career of one, grown-up, little Immigrant Norweigen boy from Chicago named ***** Rockne.<br /><br />As a biopic, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American(1940), came out relatively close to the death of ***** ****** in a 1930 plane crash. It was about 10 years after that the film was released. That would mean that preliminary work on the project started about 8 years after our Nation's great loss of ** * Rockne.<br /><br />His likeness and voice were well known from Newspapers, ***** and Motion Picture News Reels. Both *****'s *****,****** ****** ******, and the University of ***** **** had approval rights in choosing the Actor to play the Lead and okaying the script. We think that they could not have done the job any better. *** O'Brien truly looks the part and was himself a footballer in college. ****** Reagan is cast in the pivotal role of ****** ******, a free spirited student going to ***** **** on a Baseball scholarship! He was a "walk-on" football player.<br /><br />The cast runs full of talented players. We have ******** *******,****** ***** as Fr. Callaghan, C.S.C., ***** **** President. ****** ********* is Fr. Newland, the Chemistry Prof and Rockne mentor. **** Page appears as the Mrs., ****** ****** ******. **** Davis,Jr. is Rockne cohort, *** ******(the passer in that historic ND vs. ARMY Game at West Point.)<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by **** ********, **** ******, ******* ******** and ******* ***** as the Four Horsemen. Real life Big Time ******* ******* ****** *****, 'Pop' ******, **** ********* and **** ****** ***** appear as themselves in scenes of Congressional Probe into ******* ****** and add an authentic touch. <br /><br />As for biopic,KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American!,all one can only say that it hits the ground running, and did not slow down from beginning to end. There is no wasted time either. All the screen time is used to move the story along. <br /><br />Use of ***** **** *****, the Campus itself and all that ***** **** rah-rah march music all ad to the feeling of really being there.***<br /><br />* To this day,even though their Basketball Team and other sports teams compete in the Big East Conference, ***** **** remains an Independent in NCAA Football. What this means, that in effect, The Fighting Irish play a national schedule.<br /><br />** There was no such agreement with the Family of ****** ****. There was a lawsuit some years ago over the scene portraying young *** **** giving the famous "Win Onr For The Gipper Speech". Television prints of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were minus the speech in the death bed scene.<br /><br />*** Other ***** **** themed ***** were made over the years. THE SPIRIT OF NOTRE DAME (Universal 1931)featured J. ******* ******** as a Rockne look-alike coach. It also featured *** *****, **** ****** *** *********, as well as the members of the real ***** **** Championship Teams featuring the real Four Horsemen. Then of course, we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993)with **** *****, *** *******, *** ****** and ******* ******, among others, in a fine cast. There was also talk of an unauthorized film, critical of ***** **** called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing has materialized, has it?(Let me know, **** ******, THANX!!)<br /><br />**** ****** ******** always had great music in their, both in opening themes and in incidental music. In this Rockne Movie, they have incorporated THE NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG in the score. Along with it were STEP NOTRE DAME and THE NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, which had its premiere at the Rockne Funeral in 1930 at the ***** **** Basilica.
