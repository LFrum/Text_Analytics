******** ****** (***** ********) and Dr. ****** (***** *****) have been hired by the British government to protect a Swiss scientist Dr. ***** ***** (******* **** Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately the evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel ******) is working with the Nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor--and his invention.<br /><br />Moving ******** ****** to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea but it does work for one reason--***** ********. Arguably he is the BEST ******** ****** ever put on the screen. He plays the character so well (and accurately) that it doesn't matter what era he's solving crimes. As for ***** ***** as ******...everybody has problems with it. He plays ****** as a bumbling old fool...that is NOT the ****** of the books. You seriously wonder why ****** puts up with him. Still, he does grow on you (in a way). Then there's ****** having a whale of a time playing Moriarty--the discussions and battle of wits between him and ****** are just great! I've never liked ****** **** as ********* ********--he's such an idiot. ***** ****** look like a genius. And **** Jr. is pretty good as Tobel (even though his accent amusingly keeps changing!).<br /><br />This movie is done elaborately and runs only a little over an hour. Still, it does have it's slow spots and I never understood the secret code section.<br /><br />Still, worth catching if just for Rathbone and ******.
