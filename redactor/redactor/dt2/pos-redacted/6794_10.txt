This movie is ageless and would probably appeal to children today, even if there isn't a Jedi in the entire thing. Of course, ********* ****** was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too. Even ****** ****** is good; so are **** ****** and ****** ********. The world was a different place when this movie was released, and it certainly is a great place to visit.
