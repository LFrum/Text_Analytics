I thought this movie was great, not only because of it's storyline but because it was portrayed greatly by the excellent cast. I read that **** ********* wasn't exceptional as ***** ****** because she is beautiful. Yes she maybe but in the movie she played outside herself, which brought on a plain girl searching for who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, I for sure am. ***** Arquette is mad as her brother ***, and ******* ****** is gorgeous as *** *******. ****** ******** did an excellent job as her mate *****, someone who wasn't afraid to be herself. I think this movie should get more credit rather than being branded as a "teeny boppy" flick
