My take on the ending. ***** died at the hands of his step father. **** had tried as he may to get ***** out. Only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. ***** died.... **** as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind...on how ***** left....**** made a plane that flew ***** out. Children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive.<br /><br />Was also great seeing my old housing area. We called it *** **** ********* and I lived right around where these house were filmed. It was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses...not studios... It was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. And those hills...we use to hike them as kids....looking down on our little valley....seeing glimpses of the bay. Was a real nostalgia trip for me.
