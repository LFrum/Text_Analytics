Well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally got it right! In this 4th sequel to the ****** *** franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well first of all I applaud them for finally getting rid of ***** *******. I felt he never did service to the role of the ****** ***. I would have rather have seen ***** 'Ralph *****' Most in that role. ******* turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put in a girl! They got ******* *****, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she is in. I personally don't care for her buck teeth, but thats a personal preference. But still, look how ****** *** 4 launched her career into orbit! She won a freakin Oscar. ******* Christmas! Meanwhile where is ******?? He should put out some amateur porn tape like ******* or something.<br /><br />Anyways, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. As a self-proclaimed master of Karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls... well except for ****... but thats kinda gay. So for the purposes of accuracy, I think they should have stuck with another male for this role. I was thinking perhaps ****** *****. He would give the role the depth it requires.<br /><br />Perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in ****** *** 5. Its too *** ****** is no longer. I was thinking maybe ****** ******* is the perfect replacement for the lovable Asian fellow *** ******. He will give "Wax on wax off" a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? Anyways, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with Karate and triumph of the human spirit, ****** *** 4 is for you. Don't waste your time with 1-3. This is the ****** *** for you! This is the ****** *** for r the ages!
