"House of *******" is a good sequel to "House of ************". There isn't as much action but the acting is just as good. Onslow ******* is the benevolent Doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from ******* via a transfusion(******* was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome his "affliction" but he puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfuses his blood into the Doctor.). It turns out that ******* really didn't come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse. ******* is destroyed and the **** *** is next in line for a cure(which is successful). In the meantime, ************'s monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death(don't worry, the same trio came back in "****** and Costello meet ************"). **** ********* again plays a sinister *******(***** ***** is his alias at the start of the film and in "House of ************"). *** Chaney is the sympathetic **** *** and ***** ******* returns as the ************ monster. ****** ****** again plays an inspector, which he often does in the Universal Studios monster films. A keeper for your collection.
