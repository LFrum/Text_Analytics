I love this movie... it can make me laugh! =^_^= ***** is kinda hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever. It doesn't warp the characters like other movies out there. Everyone is in character and has a role to play!<br /><br />The movie focuses around ****** and **** going down river after a flood (courtesy of ******), to Plucky going on a trip with ****** (hilarious stuff), ****** running around torturing animals (as usual), **** following her crush around for an autograph, and ******* and ********* going to the movies.<br /><br />In my own personal opinion, I didn't like the ****** and **** segments that much, although they had some notable dialogue and jokes. I have got to say the Plucky and ******* 'Vacation' parts were the best! ******'s family is HILARIOUS! I especially like ***** ******. **** in the hotel was also hilarious. I love the actor cameos during this scene. :D<br /><br />Probably the most famous part in this movie, again IMHO, is when ********* and ******* are in the movie theater... LOL! You've got to see it to appreciate it! And when ****** and Plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish... :)<br /><br />Although this movie moved slowly during the ******/**** parts, the rest is pure gold! I rate this movie 8/10. Show this to your kids one day... or even adults yourselves - WATCH THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it.
