THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought that Eric (***** ******) and ***** (****** *****) looked good in their prom attire. To me, Ned (******* *********) was a real bully. This was because he got ***** in trouble with ********* ****** (****** *****). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (******* ********) was a pure a******! This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes. My favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between ***** and the Alpha Elite. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial-arts flicks or are fans of ****** *****.
