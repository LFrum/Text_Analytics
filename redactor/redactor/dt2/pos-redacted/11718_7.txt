I think this is one of Burts top five movies, along with Deliverance, Smokey and the Bandit, ****** ****** and City Heat. He also directed this one so he had a talent for that too like his buddy ***** ********. I wish he made more films like this or even a sequel to ******* ******* than the likes of ******* *** or Cannonball Run II. This is a tough, gritty cop thriller with ******** at the top of his game. Having the beautiful ****** **** in it of ***** ***** fame helped too. ***** ***** is the bad guy and he always does a good job at that. The film also a great soundtrack too. I highly recommend this, wish it was on DVD in the UK, an audio commentary from ******** would be great as well. ***7/10***
