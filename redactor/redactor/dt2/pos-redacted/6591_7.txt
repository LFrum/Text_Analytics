******* is a man that makes a living out of duping other solid citizens of their hard earned money. Together with *****, an older man with a lot of experience, he pulls out capers that allow him to make a decent living, but that is not making him a rich man by any means. ***** ********, an older man who is more experience in the art of deception. Together with the younger ******* they prove a winning combination. That only lasts until *****, ********'s former love interest, appears in the picture.<br /><br />This Spanish film directed by ****** ******, is light in tone and pleasant to sit through. Other, better made caper films have been made with much clever plots than this one, but the film is easy to take, and at times, it has a lot of funny situations.<br /><br />This viewer will see ******** ***** in anything, even reading the telephone directory! He is an actor's actor. We have had the privilege of having seen him in the Buenos Aires stage doing excellent work before his international film career. As ********, he does what he does best. It's impossible to imagine anyone better in his role. ******* Alterio, the son of ****** *******, is a young actor who promises to have a great career. Victoria Abril makes ***** fun as she gets involved with these con men. ****** *********, a veteran actor, is also good as *****.
