Three kids are born during a solar eclipse and turn into vile murderous little tykes who're above suspicion by everyone, save for Joyce (Lori Lethin) and her younger brother *****. That's the story in a nutshell. The acting in this one is tolerable for the most part. Notable for MTV-J ***** ***** (not the 'Downtown' one) showing some skin, and a very early part (albiet small) for ******* ********. Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but in the 'killer kids' sub-genre it's a bit of a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Eye Candy: ***** ***** shows T&A (the only film thus far, to claim that honor); ****** ****** gets topless <br /><br />DVD Extras (R1): 16 minute interview with ******** *** ********* (wherein he insults the director AND Canada, great stuff); Biography of ** ****; and trailers for "Kiss of the Taratula", "Don't open the Door", & a red-band one for "Homework" (which features nudity) <br /><br />My Grade: B-
