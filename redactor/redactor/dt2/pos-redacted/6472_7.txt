***** ****** led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in ***** ****** *** ********. We follow ******'s incredible journey from young Norwegian boy to iconic American football legend. Produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey. And the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as ****** is glowingly and lovingly portrayed. You may come away thinking ****** should have been nominated for sainthood when in fact he was, after all, just a football coach. But it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached. This film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this day.<br /><br />Playing ******, *** ******* gives an impressive performance. It's unquestionably O'Brien's movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own. The real-life ****** was renowned as a great inspirational figure and O'Brien's performance will make you understand why. The only quibble comes early in the film when O'Brien, in his early forties, is playing the college student ****** in his early twenties. All the makeup in the world wasn't going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring. But as the ****** character ages and begins his legendary coaching career O'Brien fits the part perfectly.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course ****** ****** playing the young, charismatic, but ultimately doomed football star ****** ****. In the grand scheme of the film it's not really a large part, with ****** appearing for no more than 10-15 minutes. But the performance has become legendary thanks to ******'s famous "Win one for the Gipper" deathbed speech. It's a brilliantly-played scene, chock-full of emotion. ****** may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performance.<br /><br />The rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with ****** having great lessons for his young men in both areas. For football fans (and history buffs) there is a rare treat as actual archival footage from ***** **** games of the ****** era is interspersed throughout the film. It's a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last six-plus decades and an opportunity to see ******'s legendary strategic innovations put into practice. If you're a ***** **** fan you'll probably enjoy the fact that the ***** **** Victory March provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film. If you're a ***** **** hater...well, then you're probably not watching this movie anyway. ***** ****** *** ******** is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional film. Perhaps a tad overly sentimental but that's not such a bad thing. It's a very enjoyable film, one well worth taking the time to see.
