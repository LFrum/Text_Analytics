I sort of liked this ******* movie its atmosphere, which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film-noir, in the movie its first 30 minutes or so. It's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way, with the right camera angles and use of light. It doesn't mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late ******* movie entry. It's definitely a better movie than the average 'later' ******* movie entry.<br /><br />26 years after his previous ******* movie appearance, ****** ******** returns once again to play the main lead opposite ***** ****, again as the murderer, in a total different and new role of course. I liked him in his role and he was a good ******* ********', who gave the good old Lieutenant some good competition. They had some nice sequences together. Problem with the 'modern' new ******* movies always sort of had been that it didn't feature a good well known actor opposite ***** ****. This movie obviously doesn't suffer from this problem. But I must say though that this movie doesn't feature ***** **** at this best. He has certainly played the character better and his performance isn't quite consistent enough within this movie, which is probably also due to he movie its director ***** ****, who also directed the really dreadful movie "Tai-Pan", among many other projects.<br /><br />It has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier ******* movie also doesn't help of course. It got used before in the 1975 movie "*******: Playback". Nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough 'original' moments of its own with its story, even though of course in essence every ******* movie is more or less the same. But oh well, that is what made the ******* series so great and consistent. If it ain't broke don't fix it.<br /><br />It also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the Lieutenant, which doesn't mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but I more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others. It doesn't make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable, to see ******* hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues. Luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective relieving *******-comedy.<br /><br />Simply a good late ******* movie entry.<br /><br />7/10
