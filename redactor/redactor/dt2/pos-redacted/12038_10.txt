This is a hard movie to come by in the US, but if you can find it -- and you're interested in the life and music of ***** ******** ********, you're in for a treat. It's quite historically accurate. ******* **********'s ******** looks astoundingly like ******** at this period in time. Emily ****'s ***** ****** is quite a bit prettier than the real *****, but that was an inaccuracy I was happy to discover (!). I think what really struck me though, was how well ********** captured ********'s outrageous personality. ******* *******'s **** was also a treasure. If she looks considerably younger than **** did at that period, it is more than made up for in how well she captured ****'s obsession with *****. It's an easy film to recommend. (I should note that when she saw "Passion" my wife had no particular affinity for (or knowledge of) ******** and his music, but she was totally captivated by the film.
