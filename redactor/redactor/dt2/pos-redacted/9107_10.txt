I've been waiting for this movie for SO many years! The best part is that it lives up to my visions! This is a MUST SEE for any ********* * or true **** ***** fan. It's just so great to see JB, KG and *** on the big screen! It's not a true story, but who cares. The D is the greatest band on earth! I had the soundtrack to the movie last week and listened to it non-stop. To see the movie was pure bliss for me and my hubby. We've both met **** and **** after 2 different ********* * concerts and also saw them when they toured with ******. We left that concert after the D was done playing. Nobody can top their show! Long live the D!!! :D
