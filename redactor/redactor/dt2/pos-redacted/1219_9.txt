**** ****, I truly enjoyed and LOVED this movie. It was fun, funny and inspirational. I just saw it on DVD. How did I miss this one it's a winner! I mean **** was "That Guy". I wanted to marry him. This was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off. I thought ***** ****** was the best ever and I was a Felicity head too. A fearless woman who only fears her ****. Thank You for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great! ***** ***** was a Blast! ***** ****** was priceless as ****. This cute romantic comedy is "A Must See". Oh and the new comer ****** ******* is worth the surprise ladies...**** ****. Karen
