I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially ********* and *****.<br /><br />Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry. I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity ***** cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.By the way to all we westerners, ***** ****** is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.<br /><br />Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like '******' to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move. I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending ****** since the judges toppled ****** last year.<br /><br />'******' is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love, fate and destiny. I would keep away from it. Anyway, not sending a movie like ******** ******** shows how much of a revamp Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many issues. They are heavily talented but not showcased properly.
