In a bizarre experiment, an astronaut is abandoned on the moon as ***** (******** ******), a troubled translator living in Italy, wakes from a nightmare about a lunar mission mixed with an old movie that frightened her as a child. She also has no recollection of the last three days except for a torn photo of the Garma hotel she finds in her apartment. Fired from her job, ***** heads to that resort island to try and piece together the mystery...<br /><br />***** touted as a giallo due to it's director (THE FIFTH CORD's ***** *******) and the presence of Evelyn *******, ********* ****, and ***** ******, FOOTPRINTS is actually a deliberately paced psycho-thriller with sci-fi overtones. Blurring the distinction between dream, reality, memory and movies, the disturbing story is beautifully photographed by Oscar-winner Vittorio Storaro with a pensive score by ****** *******. It also combines elements of such diverse films as ******* ********'s MACCHE SOLARI and ****** ********'s DEATH IN VENICE in it's depiction of alienation, isolation, hallucination, and maybe madness. Brazilian actress ******** ******, on screen all the time, does a redux of her ***** ******* in Lucio Fulci's A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN as *****, a young woman thrust into a mystery that makes her question her sanity. The locations mirror *****'s unstable state of mind; the island of Garma, off-season, with it's ****** influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place unwilling to give up its secrets. Evelyn ******* has a bit in the beginning as a concerned friend, ********* **** and Oscar-winner Lila Kedrova are hotel guests, ***** ******* plays a handsome biologist trying to help ******, and the ever-intense ***** ****** is "Blackmann" in the film-within-a-film, "Footprints On The Moon". <br /><br />FOOTPRINTS is a classy case of "Guaranteed 100% Euro-weird" but not for everyone. There's only one murder toward the end but you won't see it coming as the film starts to come together.
