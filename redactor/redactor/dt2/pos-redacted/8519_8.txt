"****** ******* ****" director ***** ********'s "Never *** ***** *****," a remake of the 1965 ***** **** movie "Thunderball," doesn't surpasses the Terence Young original, but this non-Harry Saltzman & ****** ** ******** film is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado. Nevertheless, despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score, "Never *** ***** *****" rates as an above-average, suspenseful doomsday thriller with top-flight performances by a seasoned cast including **** *******, *** ********, ***** ***** *********, *** *** *****, ******* *******, ****** ***, ****** *****, **** *******, and ***** ********. The film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy 134 minutes. Unlike the franchise ***** **** sagas with their breath-taking moments of spectacle, "Never *** ***** *****" provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget. Indeed, the film features only three gadgets: an explosive ball-point pen, a wristwatch with a laser, and a souped-up motorcycle. Aside from the flavorful **** **** opening theme song, "Ice Station Zebra" composer ****** *******'s orchestral music score leaves much to be desired. Legrand replicates none of those snappy, jazz cues that made **** *****'s music for the regular **** franchise so memorable. All in all, "Never *** ***** *****" seems to fit more into the first two **** movies"Dr. No" and "From Russia With ****"and "On *** *******'s Secret Service" in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter.<br /><br />"Never *** ***** *****" presents **** *******'s ***** **** as an older 007 who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach. Ironically, ***** ***** was a year older than ******* and *****'s **** movies treated 007 as an active, young guy. **** ******* seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the Lorenzo Semple screenplay that emphasize ****'s age. Initially, ******* had lobbied to play **** without a hairpiece, but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and ******* sports a hairpiece. He looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into "Diamonds Are Forever" at the last moment to replace **** *****. ******* had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for "Diamonds Are Forever." At 52, ******* still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the script.<br /><br />The action unfolds with 007 single-handedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island. He dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman, only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he isn't looking. It seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by M (****** *** of "Day of the Jackal") to test ****'s ability. The new M doesn't share his predecessor's use of field agents. M decides that **** needs to clean out his system of all 'free radicals' and has 007 packed off to Shrublands. While at the country clinic, **** notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them. The nurse is none other than SPECTRE assassin ****** ***** (******* ******* of "The Island of Dr. Moreau") and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees USAF officer **** ******* (***** ********* of "Superman 3"). ******* is part of a SPECTRE plan by millionaire businessman ********** ***** (***** ***** ********* of "Out of Africa") to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The villains implant a duplicate eyeball into ******* ******* who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons. After he steals the weapons for SPECTRE, ****** ***** runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up. Indeed, the first part of "Never *** ***** *****," apart from the SPECTRE planning conference, belong to ****** as she supervises *******'s stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill ****, one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives device.<br /><br />Eventually, **** meets the beautiful blond ****** (*** ******** of "****** ****") and sneaks into *****'s charity banquet at a Monte Carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called 'Domination' to see who will rule the world. **** bests him and ***** hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival to ****** and a thorn in his side that not even ****** seems to be able to remove. **** and ****** have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up. Their earlier encounter in the Bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame. Like in the original "Thunderball," the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea, but just the warheads themselves.<br /><br />**** flies to the Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison, ***** Small-Fawcett (no lesser than ***** ******** of "*** ****" fame, who is worried that **** may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise. Of course, ***** Small-Fawcett serves as the film's source of comic relief. The C.I.A. sends ***** ****** (****** ***** of "Guns of the Magnificent Seven") to back up ****. This is the first time that an African-American portrayed ******. **** encounters his share of problems, involving saving ****** from **** slavers, while ****** and he save the world. "Never *** ***** *****" is a richly respectable ***** **** thriller with many neat touches, but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise **** films have. Indeed, "Never *** ***** *****" looks like a dignified Masterpiece Theatre take on 007.
