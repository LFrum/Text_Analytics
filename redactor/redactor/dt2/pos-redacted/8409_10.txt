First of all, nothing will ever compare to the original movie, but for gosh sakes, they're not trying to. It is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after ***** left ******** at Tara. I for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. Just view this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they are trying to replace ****** ***** and ***** ***** and you will enjoy it a lot. They really captured the spoiled selfishness of ******** in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from ***** that he is clearly still in love with ********. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on TV. I always wanted them to have other children after ****** **** died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly. <br /><br />Lore60
