I think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me. It is blatantly obvious once you look out for it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on The Simpsons. Layne is *****, **** is *******, and **** is *****. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where ***** uses the line "I poked her with a stick."<br /><br />The *****-Layne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice. ******* has the shaved head, unlike ****, but is the big, dumb one. The ****-***** connection is pretty obvious with the long, parted haircut and even the second-tier status.
