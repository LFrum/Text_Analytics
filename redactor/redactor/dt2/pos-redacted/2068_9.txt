Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? ****** is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. Her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. The only real exceptional performances come from ****** and *******, who is a great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but ****** is what truly elevates this teleplay.
