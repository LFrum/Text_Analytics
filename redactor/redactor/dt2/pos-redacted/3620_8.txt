Obviously made on the cheap to capitalize on the notorious "Mandingo," this crassly pandering hunk of blithely rancid Italian sexploitation junk really pours on the sordid stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint: The evil arrogant white family who own and operate a lavish slave plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in hanky panky both each other and their various slaves. ******** ***** ******** and screenwriter ***** ********* cram this fetid filth with a teeming surplus of sizzling sleaze: we've got nasty rape, interracial copulation (one white lady makes wild love to a muscular black stud while he's tied to a cross), copious female nudity, brutal whippings, vile degradation, lots of lurid soft-core sex, and a severely twisted tragic surprise ending that mixes elements of incest, murder and miscegenation in a questionable attempt at making a statement about the horrid inhumanity of slavery. Special kudos are in order for foxy brunette actress ***** ********, whose lusty and uninhibited portrayal of depraved and lascivious wicked bitch ****** positively burns up the screen. Moreover, ******** ********'s funky, throbbing tribal score hits the groovy spot. ******* Centini's fairly polished cinematography likewise does the trick. A satisfyingly seamy chunk of slimy swill.
