The Coen Brothers have done it again. Three depression era convicts(****** *******, **** ******** and *** ***** ******)escape a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson/introduction to bluegrass music.<br /><br />Clooney is outstanding as the fast talking, quick witted ******* ******* McGill. Holly ****** plays his estranged wife. Turturro and ****** are flawless stumblebums. Also in the cast are **** ******* and ******* Durning.<br /><br />*** ******** provides the singing voice for ****** ******* on "I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow", the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features ****** ******, ***** *******, The Whites, **** ********, The Cox Family and ******* *****. Toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is.
