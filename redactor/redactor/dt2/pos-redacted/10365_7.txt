This production was quite good. The usual fabulous scenery, interesting, quirky characters. It was just so strange not to have ******* ********, **** *****, and ******'s office/residence, so prominently featured in the original PBS/BBC mysteries.<br /><br />In the original series, so much took place at the office. Hastings reading the paper, while ****** "exercises his little gray cells." **** ***** pitching in whenever needed.<br /><br />****** without Capt. Hastings would be like ****** without ****** ... he can most certainly solve the crime, but it is not as interesting.<br /><br />And what would a ****** mystery be without Hastings, with his impeccable manners, falling for some beautiful, unattainable woman.
