Let me just start out by saying that ******* **** is a better movie then 99.9% of the horror films that have come out of ********* lately. If you don't believe me see ******** ***** or They. And it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like ****, *****, The Pool, and so on. One of the big problems with the film ******* **** is that is never really found an audience. When the film opened in 1979 it was given a PG rating by the MPAA. Anyone that knows horror films knows that a PG on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film. (Director ***** ********** talks about this problem on the DVD's commentary track.) There are exceptions though like Poltergeist, which had also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between ******* **** and Poltergeist. ******* **** was not a big budget ********* film like Poltergeist nor was it produced by ****** *********. That alone was enough to guarantee Poltergeist success. (Still for those of you that have seen ******* ****, you will even scratch your head as to why the MPAA rated this film PG. The 'heart burst' scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and R rating. Or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it.) I have to admit though that when I was young I looked at a copy of Poltergeist in the video store shelf, picked it up, saw that it was rated PG and put it back on the shelf in favor of an R rated film instead. Years later, I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what a great film I missed out on for not renting a PG horror film. From then on I would never judge a film based on it's rating again. This is most likely what happened to ******* ****. People, like me with Poltergeist, will probably overlook it in favor of the R rated film. Most likely it would be a teenager too, which most of these types of films are targeted at. Friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated R and was heavily advertised by Paramount at the time. It found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels. When you look at it folks, ******* **** is just as good as Friday The 13th. The same thing could've happened to ******* ****. We could have seen ******* **** 2, 3, 4, and so on. As far as the film goes, ******* **** is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget, but it is well acted, well directed and well made on many levels. ***** Connors is a riot as *** ******* and gives the best performance in the film. Special credit must be give to composer **** ********, whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness. The music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially creepy. ******** worked on the horror film ****** and many other film scores since ******* ****. He has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day. The weakness with ******* **** is that there really is never any explanation of *****'s powers. Maybe that is how it's supposed to be. He just has them, and we should accept that in order for the movie to work. We do accept it to a point, but then the screenplay has incidents like how ***** makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. In that case, is ***** limited in using his powers? Can he make a phone ring in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is his range? Those are things that people that didn't care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws. Others would accept it as a mistake. I accept it. There is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it. This is a horror film. We should not be required to read too much into it. Many people have called this the 'killer mannequin' movie. I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this film. The mannequins are controlled by the power of ***** who uses them as a weapon. This is a common misconception about this film. Some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said they are just downright silly. I think they add to the overall creepiness of the film. Overall ******* **** is a good fun rental.***(out of 5)
