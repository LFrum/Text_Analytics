One would have expected *********'s return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. Surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy. But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.<br /><br />What is remarkable is how much *****'s transgression disrupts the world of the film. Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress *** is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join. *** is the archetypal American, the working-class boy made good, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome. ***** is his destructive opposite, gay, decadent, 'European' (he lives off his father, in a Big House, and just lounges about dreaming of murder). *****'s life is one of repetition, circularity, whereas *** moves straight ahead. It is *****'s achievement to move *** into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force HIM to transgress (break the law, hope for murder (*****'s)).<br /><br />***** is quite literally fighting patriarchy. All the authority figures in the film are criticised - *****'s father, a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of, but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); ****'s incredibly Machiavellian, self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken. Far from being the mother-hater of legend, *****, as ***** **** perceived, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy.<br /><br />*****'s transgression turns the world topsy-turvy. This is *****'s most surreal film. Whenever *** is in his plot, he is filmed straight, with conventionally romantic music. But whenever ***** intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque, bizarre, much more fun. This is *****'s first truly American film, revelling in the primitive detritus of Americana. Grown men puncture little boys' balloons, or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds. Distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains. Elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees. Washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a haunting **** painting. There is one of the greatest, and funniest, scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless, smiling ***** in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match, an image worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene with ***** in it, and watch it derail into the bizarre.<br /><br />Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (***** had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in more staid environs: Washington will never look the same again. STRANGERS is also, VERTIGO notwithstanding, *****'s most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses, there is the sustained homoeroticism, the remarkable play with 'riding' horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when *****'s daughter spills powder over the policeman.<br /><br />And yet ***** doesn't stint on good old suspense. In the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place. Much has been made of ***** as a prototype of Norman Bates, and ***** plays merry havoc on audience identification, willing ***** into murder. There is a hilariously painful sequence where ***** loses the lighter with which he intends to frame *** down a drain. The gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience I was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny, slightly disturbing, and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success. And ***** milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions, and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously.<br /><br />STRANGERS is one of *****'s five best films, and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it wasn't written by ********. ******** ********* is a wonderful imp, standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts ***. The fairground finale is a remarkable, dizzying fusion of exciting, tense set-piece, black comedy and symbolic site. If *****'s final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts ***** is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to ***'s debased serving of self.
