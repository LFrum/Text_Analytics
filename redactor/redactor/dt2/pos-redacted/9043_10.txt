An unjustly neglected classic, "Intruder in the Dust" is one of the great films of the 1940's which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity. Based on a story by ******* *******, and shot in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, "Intruder" tells the story of ***** ********* (played with great dignity by ***** *********), a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man, and a white boy (****** ******, Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to Beauchamp. Terrific acting, especially by two great character actors, ****** **** (as the dead man's father) and ********* ********* (best known as Mrs. Trumbull on "I Love ****") as an old woman willing to stand against the townspeople to see that right is done. This straightforward, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more.
