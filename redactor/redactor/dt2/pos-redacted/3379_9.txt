GREAT, ***** ************** has got to be the best ***** ******** that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching ***** ******** as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.<br /><br />I had no idea that ***** was as close a friend to **** ******* as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.<br /><br />I really felt for both Val and ***** during his rough times. I am glad that they ended it in a high note!<br /><br />I hope ***** puts a $100 bill in this guy's hat !!<br /><br />And it was great that it was filmed in Vancouver!
