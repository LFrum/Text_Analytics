Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon funded film directed by **** ******. It's a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who are accidentally brought back down to Earth during the latest space shuttle mission. ***** ********* stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy. But really folks the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of ******** ***. She's one smoking hot number. The director was a huge fan of ****** ******* (a.k.a. Erotikill). **** May recreates **** *****'s title role The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There's plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happy.<br /><br />I have to give this film a very high rating. **** ****** was the man. He made three interesting films for Cannon during this time period (***** ******** ******** ** and Invaders from **** as well). If you like science fiction/horror films, **** ****** films or ******** *** this film's just up your alley.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation!<br /><br />Did I mention ******** *** is smoking hot?
