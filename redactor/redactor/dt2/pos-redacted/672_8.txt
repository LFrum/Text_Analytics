A terrific B-feature. A virtual two-hander and set over the course of a day, (you can see it's stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play), and although only 77 minutes long, played out in sequences akin to something like real time. ****** **** is the psychopath who keeps *** ****** trapped in her own home. Both are superb, especially the under-rated Lupino whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before ****'s unhinged intruder. Today, of course, it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director ***** ******, (much better known as an Art Director), only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of Hitchcock.
