I was very curious to see this *****-********* outing, plus the time period is definitely fascinating. Being a ***** fan, I was disappointed, and that may be an understatement. The film never really took cinematic flight -- there's no foundation for the animosity between ****** and ***********, etc.<br /><br />Basically, the script was weak (adapted from "The ****** ******"). And yet, the direction was masterful...it's *****, afterall! Also, there were some amazing actors BUT they never really grab the audience's attention like they should. ********* comes off as a quasi-goofy, nonchalant ******...not exactly the image we have in mind. ******* Pzsoniak is incredible, as usual, but again the script puts up limits even actors of great talent can't break down. ******* ******* and ******** ***** pop up ... as ******* and Saint-Just...and if you're familiar with *****, then you'd know them.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed with this much-lauded film. Great cast, great director, but no quality foundation. Bad, undynamic script. We need to get in ****** (Walesa) and ***********'s (General J) mindsets... what are their motivations? Eh...who knows? One likes women, the other powders himself? Riiight. Ok, so if you're looking for a great French Revolution movie I HIGHLY recommend "La Revolution Francaise"...it's in two parts and oh-so-great! Excellent performances, in-depth script, juicy tid bits...definitely a satisfying experience!! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a much better ****** than *********...the wonderful ******* ******* apparently took some notes from "******" and is BRILLIANT as ***********. SEE IT! NOW! As for ***** fans -- you're better off with "Man of Iron/Marble", "Promised Land", and the like. Cheers!!
