Once again ***** is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. **** of *****. He's unsure of what season it is and ***** and **** arguing help matters not. Though **** proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on ***** in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. ***** freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though ***** is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. ***** really is to blame for all this. If he weren't so dumb he'd know it REALLY is duck season and just blast *****. But poor old Daff can't believe the utter preposterousness of the situation. His cruel plans of misdirection have been foiled by *****'s dumbness. ***** is so shocked that he even goes home with ***** to be blasted in his living room.<br /><br />Poor Daff. He rules!
