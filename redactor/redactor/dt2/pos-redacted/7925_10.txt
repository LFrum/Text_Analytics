Went looking for this movie after i read *** ******'s "Red Storm Rising" novel. Timeless masterpiece about 13th century Russians being invaded by the Germans. ***** was made in 1938, under orders from ****** ****** to warn ******* about ****** and Germany. Battle scenes are wonderfully done, showing that you don't need computer animation to make a great fight scene. Probably ****** **********'s greatest work. Also see 'Battleship ********'. Any history buff or poli-sci major should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.
