Look...I've come to expect this level of acting from ******* ****...the guy just keeps putting in terrific performances...but MEAT LOAF? Just when did His Loafness decide to leave *** ******** behind and throw his decidedly lower weight around in the wonderful world of ************? Well...what can I say? I'm duly impressed. To paraphrase an old adage: "It ain't the meat, it's the emotion"...and the Loaf is quietly buffing up his acting chops of late..<br /><br />***** **** carries off the 40's look perfectly here...great job by the costume and hair departments...***** ****** is typecast but right on the money. Solid camera work throughout the flick. The plot line is reminiscent of "*********'s Agreement" (post-WWII anti-semitism). Well worth your time...particularly for the growing legions of **** **** acolytes.<br /><br />
