Wealthy businessman **** ******* (played by ****** *******) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument. Panic-stricken, he retreats to a bar, and meets *** ****** (played by ***** *****): a loud-mouth, angry, bigot who is bitter over how his beloved country has become. Unintentionally, **** allows *** to find out that he just killed a hippie. And this is only the beginning. "***" is a classic film of an unlikely friendship. A bond between two men, one of a white-collar background, the other of a blue-collar background. **** & *** have one thing in common, they are disgraced over how crazy the world has become. ****** ******* & ***** ***** have both given very realistic portrayals of their characters. Director **** ** ******* with this "pre-Rocky" effort, directs this low-budget gem with the same finesse as a movie with a $100 million budget. The script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy, realistic dialog. In spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses. The script falls asleep roughly 3/4 of the way through, but it wakes up just in time for the jarring climax. This film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24-year old ***** ******** as ****'s daughter *******, along with her hippie boyfriend *****, portrayed very blandly by ******* ** *******. One could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film. In spite of its few flaws this is one of those forgotten films of the 70's that should not be. Even though "***" is very dated to today's standards, the chemistry between ****** ******* & ***** ***** is completely relevant today, and it is the glue that holds the whole film together.
