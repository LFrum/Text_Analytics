This was the first ****** ***** cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. It was based on a silent movie called "********* ****, Jr." starring ****** ******. Back in this early ****** short, ****** did not talk nor did he have gloves. He could just whistle and play music. The song that he played was "Turkey in the Straw" using several barnyard animals as musical instruments. He plays a cow's teeth as a xylophone and he plays a nursing sow's teats like an accordion keyboard. Captain ****, however, is very mad and makes ****** peel potatoes in the galley. ****'s parrot flies up to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. ****** throws a half-peeled potato at the parrot and laughs, thus closing the cartoon. I was able to get this cartoon on tape and I really like it. I think the Disney shorts are much better than the feature length movies.
