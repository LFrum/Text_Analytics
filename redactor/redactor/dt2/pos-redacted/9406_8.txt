This great TV movie told of the 1975 murder of ****** ****** in Greenwich, Connecticut by a nephew of ***** *******. The use of the "ghost" of ****** to provide some of the details was very effective and added a lot of heart to the story. *********** ****** seemed to capture the personality of **** ******* very well. Furhman, who got so much underserved bad publicity in the O.J. Simpson trial has certainly vindicated himself by his contribution of bringing the killer to justice after about 27 years.
