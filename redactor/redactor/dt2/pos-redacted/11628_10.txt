I have seen this show when I was younger. It is a really good show to watch. It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old. ****** is definitely super DE duper. B.J. is pretty funny. ***** Bop is very cute. The kids are very cool too. This show is about learning about numbers kinda like sesame street but different type of show and characters like ****** the purple dinosaur, B.J. the yellow dinosaur with a baseball hat on his head, and **** *** the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow. The first one that started was very old ****** and Friends show. But then the second one was different to be new episodes. Also the last one in the 2000 was new scene of ******'s park. They also have a show of ****** at Universal Studios in Florida where you see ******, B.J., and **** *** and then when the show is done you get to go play, shop and meet ******. It's a very good show watch this show when you learn about many things you will like it the movie, and the live show at Universal Studios Florida.
