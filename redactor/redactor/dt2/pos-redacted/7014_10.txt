When young Frances '****' Houseman goes to summer camp with her family, she never expected to have so much fun! One night, after wandering away from a resort activity, she stumbles upon a all night dance party with ****** ****** and other fellow dancers. Quickly enthralled by the raunchy dance moves, '****' is eager to learn when she has to fill in for ***** just so she and ****** don't lose their jobs at the resort. But young '****' soon finds herself in a sticky situation; she has fallen in love with a man she knows her father will never approve of. However, when ****** is accused of stealing wallets, it is up to '****' to confirm his alibi by admitting that she was with him the night they were taken. ****** is fired anyway for getting involved with a visitor, but quickly realises what a mistake it was leaving '****'. He comes back with that famous line 'No one puts **** in a corner' and they show the resort exactly what they're made of.<br /><br />An amazing film, perfect for a girly night in. With groovy tunes, inspiring dances and a story that will make you feel all warm inside, this has got to be the greatest film of all time! **********
