****** Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as **** ****, ****** *****, ******* ***** or ***** ****** and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "****'s Rib" "Holiday" Psycho melodramas "Gaslight" "A Double Life" a great semi western "****** in Pink Tights" not to mention "My Fair Lady" or "Travels with my Aunt" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness watching "**** and ******" flashes of the old master still very much in evidence. Candice ****** gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian she was about to become. ********** Bisset is a throwback to the days of Greer ****** and ******* ***** and **** ******* steps in, teasing us, promising something spectacular that will eventually materialize in 1989 with "Apartment Zero", *** ****, as ******'s daughter is already *** ****. As tired as the formula is, it remains a Cukor film and for what I gather one of Almodovar's favorite movies.
