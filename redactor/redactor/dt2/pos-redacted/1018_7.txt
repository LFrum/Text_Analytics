"Are You in the House Alone?" belongs to the pre-cable TV days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It is well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. ******** ****** plays a High School student who gets a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but ****** is really scared. **** **** and ****** ****** play ******'s parents, ***** ******** (****'s sister) is the High School Principal and ****** ***** has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid. It's a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. ****** is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters. ****** ******, who I usually don't like, gives a truly moving performance. Nice little film.
