I first encountered ****** ****'s "Four Friends" late one night on HBO. Having never heard of it, I expected very little, but watched because I was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of **** and screenwriter ***** ****** would be like. For the next two hours or so, I sat mesmerized, watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove. A semi-autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to America growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s, "Four Friends" follows the story of ******, an eastern European immigrant (the brilliant ***** ******), from his arrival in the United States through a decade that changed the American landscape. Accompanying ****** on his journey are his friends Georgia (the radiant **** ******, in a role that sadly, she has never had the opportunity to equal), Tom (*** *******) and David (******* **********). "Four Friends" covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here, but if you haven't seen this film, I urge you to find a copy (it's just been released on DVD) and watch it. You won't be disappointed. Tesich's script is wonderfully poignant Â— at times funny, at times incredibly sad, but always fascinating and honest. **** directs with a sure hand, and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we're following. The cast is uniformly superb. This film should have made a major star out of Wasson who is truly one of this country's most wasted talents. **** ******, not your standard brainless ********* sexpot, heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film. ******* and Huddleston subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars, but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Also superb are ****** ***** and ********* ******** as ******'s parents, as well as **** ****** and **** *****. I have not been without a copy of "Four Friends" since the day after I first saw it on HBO those many years ago. It has been and remains one of my all-time favorite films for more than 20 years now. I can't recommend it enough and feel, if you give it a chance, you'll feel the same way.
