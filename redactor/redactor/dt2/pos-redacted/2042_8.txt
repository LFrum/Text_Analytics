Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. ***** ***** is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. She'e even on the PTA! But then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! ****** L. ******* is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help ***** find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. ***** has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and ******* works surprisingly well.<br /><br />Look for ***** ***, the original ******** *******, and ***** ****** finally managing to shed his St. Elsewhere TV image. The film is directed by *****' husband, who almost seems to have built the whole film around her, but it works.<br /><br />I pull out this DVD and rewatch it often. I still love the makeup scene. Is ***** hot or what?
