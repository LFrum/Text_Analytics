***** *****, as everyone knows, is the man. In this film, he portrays *** ***** (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare handsand won (interesting guylook him up). Anyway, ***** only kills one bull in the film but it's a memorable scene and as the liner notes say, right up there with the zombie vs. shark scene in Zombi! The film also offers up loads of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plot to boot, though I don't believe all of it is true. This film is the first of the ***** trilogy ***** made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action. Finally, three neat little tidbits; part of the opening theme was used in **** **** Volume 1, ***** himself appears in the opening sequences, and that is because he trained ***** in real life for five years!
