An assassination thriller in the mould of Day Of The Jackal, In The Line Of Fire has the added twist that ********'s old-timer bodyguard ***** ******** is troubled by past failure on the job. The chase becomes personal as **** *********'s reptilian assassin Leary taunts him over this neurosis - with the rather clunky exception of the love of a good woman (Russo's ***** ******) nothing's going to set *****'s mind at rest than taking Leary down personally.<br /><br />********* is a volatile presence - not simply combustible on screen but often a changeable actor too. This is one of his good films, focused and playing director ********'s game. ******** is too old but a) the audience don't care, cos it's him and b) his age is written into the script, not only in the narrative but also as a recurring joke. Pretty much as you'd expect but well-handled. 7/10
