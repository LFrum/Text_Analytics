Attend the tale of ******* ****...The strangest, most off-putting, but most wonderful Broadway musical. It is chilling, funny, and moving all at once through ********'s most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. ****** Hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary demon barber, while ****** ******** provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, "******* ****" is a real treat.
