There is a clever little scene in The ***** Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and ******* makes an impromptu decision to have ***** sing for the owner of the studio.<br /><br />******* picks the wrong key for ***** to sing in, so ***** is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. ******* quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is *****'s amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take. Nicely done! For some reason, I have never forgotten that scene.<br /><br />The ***** Carpenter Story chronicles the meteoric rise of the Carpenters, and *****'s struggle to overcome anorexia. A lot of things are glossed over. This isn't a documentary, and the movie left me with a lot of questions. Very little is mentioned of *****'s solo venture (the CD was released only a few years ago. If you buy it, you will wonder why they waited. It's some of *****'s best work. The songs aren't as timeless as her work with brother *******, but it was a great recording, in my opinion).<br /><br />I have heard it said that, you can be listening to a cheap, time-worn little radio in the middle of the Third World, that would seem to produce more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song comes on the radio, you would think you were listening to a $1000 Hi-Fidelity unit.<br /><br />Watch this movie!
