A heroic young trail scout leads a large party of pioneers along THE BIG TRAIL to the West, with Indian attacks, natural disasters & romantic complications all part of the adventure.<br /><br />As sweeping & magnificent as its story, ***** *****'s THE BIG TRAIL is a wonderful film, as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago. With very good acting and excellent production values, it lives up to its reputation as the talkies' first epic Western.<br /><br />**** *****, pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role, looks impossibly young, but he immediately impresses with the natural charm & masculine authority he brings to the hero's role; he quietly dominates the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star. Marguerite ********* is fetching as a lovely Southern belle who slowly warms to the Duke's attentions. Dialect comic El Brendel is great fun as a Swedish immigrant beset with mule & mother-in-law woes; his appearance in a scene signals laughs for the viewer.<br /><br />Looking & sounding like a human grizzly bear, ****** ***** Sr., vast & repulsive, makes a wonderful villain. Slick cardsharp *** ***** is a sophisticated bad guy. (His famous physical similarity to **** ******* is very apparent here.) Silent movie character actor ***** ******** is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train. Corpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly fur trapper, puts his vocal talent for making nonsense noises to good use. Sharp-eyed movie mavens will spot **** **** as one of the Missouri settlers.<br /><br />What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed in an early wide screen process, called ********. More than living up to its name, the picture looks marvelous, with ***** showing a mastery of the new technology. He fills the screen, every portion of it, with action. Notice during the crowd scenes, how everyone is busy doing real work, which adds so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences. ***** deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen. In addition, the film is blessedly free of the rear projection photography which blights so many older films. It should also be stressed that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive; talkies were still in their cradle. That ***** was able to use a microphone at all, with most of the scenes shot out of doors, is more kudos for him.<br /><br />THE BIG TRAIL was not a box office success. In 1930, ******* ******' comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for fare other than intelligent Westerns. Most of the cast slipped into obscurity, including *****. It would not be until 1939, when **** **** rescued him in STAGECOACH, that **** *****'s legend would begin in earnest. And despite its grand & sweeping vistas, it would be another 25 years before wide screen caught on with *********, largely as an answer to the economic threat from television.
