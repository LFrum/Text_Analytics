"A Slight Case of Murder" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. ******* H. **** is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines ("Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe **** **** an apology" and my personal favourite "For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day? and Why is it always raining?). The film has a great supporting cast including ****'s real life wife ******* *******, ***** ******** and **** *****. A must see for **** fans!
