It's possible to have a good time with this film while, at the same time, regretting all that it isn't. In the 1980s, a raffish U.S. congressman (*** *****) engineers support for Afghan partisans resisting the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Hanks is in breezy, hail-fellow-well-met form as roguish, politically incorrect ******* ******, first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply available looking women. If only the film had the same air of insouciance; but apart from ****** ******* *******'s turn as a cynical CIA agent, it tries to be perceived as patriotic too. ***** ******'s trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of ******'s tall tales. And there's an oddly unspoken subtext: ******'s Afghan pals later mutated into the Taliban and other anti-western groups, leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred.
