******** Santoshi tries his hands at comedy and succeeds. One of the few good movies that involves ****** ****. A very funny movie from start to finish. All the characters contribute to the movie and believe me, there are a lot of them. ***** Khan, ****** ****, ******* ******, ******** ******, ****** *****, **** *****, Jagdip, ***** *****, ****** ******, ****** *****, **** ******** and more. The direction, editing, sound are not up to par, but that still does not matter, because the actors more than make up for that part.
