"The ***** ***** Story" shows the famous singer's beginnings in the dunk *******, Texas, to his rise to stardom, to his tragic death in a plane crash. Strengthened by the fact that **** *****, as *****, plays his own instruments, this movie is the biopic in its purest form. There are some things that seem a little hackneyed, namely the people of ******* considering rock 'n' roll to be the devil's music, but the masterful performances outweigh any weaknesses. If there's only one thing that's for certain in this great big world of ours, it's that ***** *****'s music will never get stale. Whether it's "That'll Be the Day", "***** ***", or another one of his songs, they still sound great after all these years. He remains one of the greatest singers in history.<br /><br />Just to show what ******* really thought of their most famous son, they didn't name a street after him until 37 years after his death! What a bunch of ingrates!
