The first episode of 'Man to Man with **** *******' that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of '***** ********'s *********' and had me at "My Maisonette". Hope it keeps up the good work of 'faux terribles' on my TV. ******* ****** is one of the best in the new breed of "alternative comedy"(I hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one.) comedians on TV today.I'm glad that on a trip of local DVD retailers today "***** ********'s *********" was sold out across the board. Even from his brief stint in Nathan Barley I knew that ****** was a serious talent and I'm sure he would have been great as ***** ********** in 'The ****** *****' To continued success! In the vein of these programs I also felt it necessary to extend my review, in order to secure a place on this public domain.
