Dolemite is a blaxploitation film about, well, Dolemite and his army of kung fu killer women, led by ***** ***. He fights to get his club, The Total Experience, back from ****** ***** by utilizing their kung fu abilities and their devotion to him. I liked this movie because of the witty dialogue and also the use of **** *** *****'s ability to preach to his brothers in rhyme.
