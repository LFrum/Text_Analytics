This is a gem of a film, ********* violence a-plenty, ***** pegg and ***** Spew.<br /><br />A suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this stonker. <br /><br />If you haven't seen this I can highly recommend it, maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short.<br /><br />If you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film.<br /><br />I didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ******* and Eddie are both ghosts.<br /><br />**** - 1 boiled egg.
