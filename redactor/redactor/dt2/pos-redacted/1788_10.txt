After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television permitted ****** to create an even more elaborate follow-up as her second special. ********* wisely knew, in order to follow in the ground-breaking success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. Even more impressively, ********* managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA.<br /><br />Once again, the special is divided into three distinct Acts. Filming on location at Bergdorf Goodman's department store was so successful in the first special, that ********* and company decided to film on location once again for the first Act of this second special. The decided-upon location this time was the Philadelphia Art Museum, which would allow endless chances for ****** to "enter" different art works that would correspond with the songs being performed. In addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that this location made possible, the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to take advantage of filming in color.<br /><br />After the recording of "**** ** a Circle" that is set against the opening credits, ****** then dashes around the museum in a maid costume to the strains of Kern and *******'s "Yesterdays." She stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the character that is depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song. ********* performs a bittersweet rendition of Hammerstein and *******'s "One Kiss" as ****** *****'s CONCERT SINGER, delivers a hilariously campy performance of Chopin's "****** *****" as ***** **********, embraces abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of ***** ****'s "Gotta Move," and performs a wrenching rendition of "*** C'est Rien" as a distraught ********** girl. The high point of Act I, however, is when ********* compares profiles with the bust sculpture of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, while singing a tour de force rendition of Rogers and ****'s "Where or When." The Act II circus medley allows ********* to interact with various farm and circus animals, while singing various songs with farm/circus/animal themes. Some highlights include ****** singing "Were Thine That Special Face" to a baby elephant, performing "I've Grown ********** to that Face" as a serenade to a piglet, the campy "***, You Made the Pants to Long" sung to a group of baby penguins, and ****** comparing profiles with an anteater while crooning "We Have So Much in Common." ********* also swings on a trapeze and leaps from a trampoline to the chorus of "Spring Again," and then slows things down by performing a haunting version of "I Stayed *** **** at the Fair" while seated alone on stage. ****** also gets the chance to show off her pet poodle ***** in this segment, and even speak a little French.<br /><br />The Act III concert is once again the high point of the hour. Dressed in a slenderizing white wool dress, the concert segment is performed on a uniquely-designed stage with a partial staircase that leads nowhere. ********* opens the Act with a sultry rendition of Harold Arlen's "Anyplace I **** ** *** Is ****," before launching into heartfelt versions of the familiar standard "It Had to Be You" and the rarely-heard "C'est Si Bon (It's So Good)." ********* then really amazes the audience with a breathtakingly powerful, octave-soaring performance of the Sweet Charity ballad "Where Am I Going," of which ********* delivers the definitive rendition of. ********* also introduces the then-newly written ******* ******, Jr.-David Shire ballad "Starting Here, Starting Now," which contains an impassioned vocal from ********* that ranks among the very best vocal performances of her long career.<br /><br />More than anything else, ***** ** ****** was a showcase for *********'s ever-increasing, mega-watt star power. Despite the presence of even more visual razzle-dazzle, ********* herself is always the main attraction. Her voice sounds as beautiful as ever, and this special was the first to showcase how strikingly she photographs in color. As with MY NAME IS BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another rating-smash and spawned yet another Top-Five, Gold-selling soundtrack album. ****** put, COLOR ME BARBRA defies tradition and emerges as a sequel that is nearly on par with a classic original.
