This early ****** Brothers talkie "Son of the Gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that Anglo-Saxon Americans show towards the Chinese. Chinese-Americans are treated like second-class citizens, and whites hold them in nothing but contempt.<br /><br />Prolific scenarist ******* **** based her screenplay on *** *****'s novel about a young, impressionable Chinaman, *** *** (******* *********** of "Only Angels Have Wings"), who experiences racial prejudice first-hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about *** once they learn about his heritage. *** goes to his father, *** **** (E. Alyn ****** of "Gone With The Wind"), who is a wealthy Chinaman with offices not only in New York City but also in San Francisco. *** feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave New York and go where he cannot be hurt by Americans. His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. *** has yet to learn this lesson. He refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to London, England, peeling potatoes while he is on board.<br /><br />During the trip, he encounters a British playwright, Bathurst (****** **** of "Arrowsmith"), who needs some help writing a play about the Chinese. *** and he strike up a friendship and *** furnishes him with cultural information about Asians. While they are relaxing in France, *** meets a beautiful young woman, ****** ****** (Constance ******* of "Two-Faced Woman"), who falls madly in love with him. It seems that ****** and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. Everybody at the motel knows about *** being a Chinaman with the exception of ******. Sensitive about his racial heritage, *** holds ****** at arm's length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him. They fall madly in love together. ******'s father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that *** is a Chinaman and all the memories of living in San Francisco and dealing with coolies floods ******'s mind. She storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs *** with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on-lookers.<br /><br />Of course, *** is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. He thought that ****** loved him but she didn't. About this time, ***'s father *** **** falls tragically ill and Ying's secretary of sorts, ****** (******* *** **** of "**** ***") sends *** a telegram about Ying's illness. Predictably, *** rushes home to New York to be at his father's side. Since his public humiliation, *** has vowed to show no kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans; ****** is an Irish-Catholic and probably one of his few white friends. *** **** dies and *** assumes control of the business and he practices his anti-White racism, until he learns that he was an Anglo-Saxon foundling that a San Francisco cop on the beat gave to *** **** and his wife to bring up. The cop forgot about it until two white busy-bodied social worker types wanted to take *** away from the Yings. *** learns this revelation about the same time that ****** comes to New York and falls ill. During her illness, she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see *** and requests that *** visit her in order to help her recover. Unbeknownst to ******, *** does visit her and she improves, but she has no memory of his visit, merely a hazy notion. Eventually, ****** learns the truth about *** not being a Chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after.<br /><br />This socially conscientious ****** Brothers/First National ******** ******* contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that *** has no Chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise. The reconciliation between ****** and *** stretches credibility, despite their self-professed undying love for each other. However, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it, they wind up in each other's arms.<br /><br />The capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that *** isn't Chinese damages some of the film's moral power. Incredibly, "Son of the Gods" is a Pre-Code film that almost seems prudish; for example, *** is an American, not Chinese! Constance ******* gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips *** with her riding crop. ****** **** is good as Bathurst, and E. Alyn ****** is convincing as *** ****. Interestingly, ****** made a career out of portraying Asian characters. ******* *********** is flawless as ***; he delivers a highly nuanced performance. Despite its age, "Son of the Gods" is a son of a good movie!
