***SPOILERS*** Even though the movie "They Made Me A Criminal" is nowhere as good as the later **** ******** anti-hero classics like "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Force of Evil" in 1948 and his last and very underrated "He Ran All The Way" in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on May 21, 1952 at the young age of 39. <br /><br />Garfiled plays the part of light ****** ******** ******* ********* and later the fugitive from the law **** ****** who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with, even though he's been declared officially dead. ******'s manager *** ****, ****** "***" ********, who during a drunken victory party killed reporter ******* *****,**** *******, who was going to expose to the public his fighter ******* ********* lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma's boy. *** ******** smashed a bottle over McGee's head killing him as ****** was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite. <br /><br />*** was later killed in a car crash with *******'s girlfriend ******, *** ********, but *** burned to a crisp and with *******'s watch on him was mistaken for *******. Told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer ****** ,****** *******, who took $9,750.00 of the $10,000.00 of *******'s money that he had for this great piece of advice. ****** told ******* to take on a new identity and call himself from now on **** ****** and get the hell out of the state of New York; talking about sleazy shysters. ******* now **** ****** travels the rails from New York down to Arizona ending up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm where most of the film takes place.<br /><br />If it wasn't for **** ******** in the lead role as both ****** ********* & **** ****** the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. Garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie. Even the transported Dead End ****, I guess we can call them The ******* **** here, acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies. All that due to being on the same stage, or filming location, with **** ********. <br /><br />"They Made Me a Criminal" is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair. In the end **** showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl *****, ****** *******, to open up a gas station with it. <br /><br />Giving the European champ ****** *******, ***** *****, the fight of his life and getting $2,000.00, thats $500.00 a round, for doing it **** showed everyone who looked up to him like the "******* ****" that sometimes taking a punch is far braver and more courageous then throwing one.The fact that **** could have easily clobbered ******* but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police, as on the loose killer ******* *********. But instead went as far as he could taking everything that ******* could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together. <br /><br />I for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story. The cop ***** ******, ****** *****, who came to Arizona from New York to arrest **** had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We were told all this right at the start of the movie. Why knowing that ************ was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again? I can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies.
