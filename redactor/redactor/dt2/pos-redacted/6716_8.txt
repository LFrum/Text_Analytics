"Lifeforce" is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel "The Space Vampires" by ***** ******, scripted by *** O'Bannon & *** ******. A joint American-British space exploration team makes a mind-boggling discovery: an alien spacecraft resting inside *******' Comet, containing three entities that look like people, one of them a female beauty (the oh-so-alluring ******** ***).<br /><br />They take these discoveries back on board their own spacecraft. Big mistake.<br /><br />It turns out that these creatures drain the life out of human beings, and as American colonel Carlsen (an intense, edgy, and committed ***** *********) and British S.A.S. colonel Caine (a solid ***** *****) watch in horror, an infestation of vampirism overtakes London, with the fate of Earth in the balance.<br /><br />This picture certainly is not lacking in imagination. It moves a little slowly at times but offers so many strange and fanciful ideas and eye-popping visuals that it's hard not to be amused. The first of director **** *******' three-picture deal with ****** ***** (he followed it up with "***** ******** ******** II" and the "Invaders from ****" remake), he makes it something truly unique. Incorporating elements of sci-fi, vampire films, zombie films, and end-of-the-world sagas, it's like nothing that I've seen before.<br /><br />Railsback and Firth are ably supported by such strong Brit actors as ***** ******, ******* *******, ******* *******, ****** ******, and **** ******. ******** *** is very memorable as the bewitching, enigmatic villainess; it certainly doesn't hurt that she performs a great deal of her scenes in the nude. Also worth noting is a stirring music score from none other than "Pink *******" composer ***** Mancini.<br /><br />Ridiculous it may be, but I found it to be fun as well. It's flamboyant and spirited entertainment.<br /><br />8/10
