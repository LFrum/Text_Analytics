I have to agree with the previous author's comments about the excellent performances and plot. Started watching this movie by accident...(lazy Sunday afternoon clicking channels to see if anything good was on)...and was mesmerized by ****** ***** and ****** *******. Wow! Gut wrenching! Kudos to everyone (have always admired ****** *****) but was particularly impressed with ******! Excellent job of acting and directing...simply superb! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I'll have to spread the news.
