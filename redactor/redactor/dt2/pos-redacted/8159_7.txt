Opposites attract when ***** and Christian meet, and sparks begin to fly.<br /><br />"Featuring two star-making performances from Sandvoss and Ramsey, the film also features a terrific supporting cast including **** *** *****, ****** *************, and international screen legend ********** ******," according to the DVD sleeve description. Not to mention some sweet vocalizations from ******* ****** (as Julie), the stock sympathetic roommate. Debuting director *** turns his otherwise ordinary "Latter Days" into a enjoyable and touching drama, due to some story surprises and an engaging team.<br /><br />******* Latter Days (7/10/03) C.
