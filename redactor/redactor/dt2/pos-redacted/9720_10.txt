Each story has a lesson for young and old. But what more I have to say may spoil a future story. But, I believe what I have to say is for everyone; just for one particular episode: The Soldier and *****.<br /><br />Okay... of all the stories the one that sticks out for me is "The Soldier and *****" because is was the point in my life I realized that life was terminal. I am not kidding. The airing was on my 8 1/2 birthday... and I will always remember it. I didn't remember its title until tonight, but I new the synopsis. (May 15th, 1988)<br /><br />It is always difficult to explain that ***** is a natural part in Life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am living proof (currently 28 yrs old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults...<br /><br />I write this with tears in my eyes. ***** ****** - a wonderful actor my own age - died today. It kinda reminded me of many lessons I have learned in my life. So I write this as a reminder to Young and Old... no one is immune to whatever is in store for us.<br /><br />I hate to say that ***** is going to happen, but this Story was the first time I saw ***** as not a bad thing; but a part of Life, was quite literally in this story. I can't help it. It was a life changing moment for me and will alway be.<br /><br />And for that...<br /><br />I love you *** ****** (and I still remember much of your work in life up until the day you died, and your memorial ****** ****) and thank you ***** ****** for keeping the Workshop alive!!! Honest, I do thank you, all of your co-workers, editors, and interns.<br /><br />The stage is just a stage/ And a show is just a show/ But *********** will create Magic/ That Forever the world will Know.<br /><br />Thank you!!!<br /><br />(And for all who doubt me... Dance, ***** *****)
