Watching the preview of ******* I thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film. Thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic. There never is the perfect crime, and ******* showed why. The movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals. The last hour of the film is very entertaining. **** ****** is still a very good actor. **** to believe ****** is 50 years of age. I would buy this movie. I give ******* eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie. Did I write ten lines yet? Nope! Anyways, there is not to many action films. ******* has a lot of excitement in it, which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy.
