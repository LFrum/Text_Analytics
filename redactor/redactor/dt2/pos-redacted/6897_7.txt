I SELL THE DEAD (2009) **1/2 ******* ********, ***** *********, *** *******, ***** ******, **** **********, ****** ******, ****** ******. Uneven blend of horror and comedy that poses as a valentine to the '60s horror films by ***** ****** and Hammer Studios, with two cretinous grave robbers (Monaghan and Fessenden) facing final punishments for the crimes via the guillotine but not before their tales of the occult can be recalled in flashbacks. Amusing and a few well sprinkled jolts but really a mess of a B-movie trying in vein to be a cult classic largely thanks to the casting of genre vets ******* and Scrimm to no avail; a good rental for *********. (Dir: ***** *******)
