It ends with the declaration that "the film you have just seen was an improvisation"-at once making you feel like an idiot for thinking an improvisation was an good movie, and astounded at **********' genius...once again. Of course, ********** told some guy it wasn't really an improvisation per se, on his deathbed, so...it's the story about a light-skinned black woman, *****, who passes for white, and her family: another passing-for-white brother named ***, and a black-black brother named ******. When she falls in love with a white jerk named ****, he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out she's black, and from there it goes on about the three main characters' individual aspirations and shortcomings. ****** is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure, *****'s still hopelessly depressed over ****, and *** is angsty and violent in general, in desperate need of something to shock him out of his stale patterns of existence. Overall, I suppose it's really about stasis vs. change in human life. I suspect that ********** had the plot organized enough, and it was just the dialogue that was improvised. The dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes somebody will say something very memorable, other times it's memorably awkward. What's amazing is the extent of the amateur actors' embodiment of their characters. ********** went through the acting class he was teaching at the time he decided to do *******, whispered in the ears of the ten best students, and this was the result...the guys playing *** and ****** are very good. At first I didn't like *****, but as the film progressed you see more and more she's one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds - not necessarily the best with small talk. ******* is hailed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement (made in 1959) and it's definitely recommended.
