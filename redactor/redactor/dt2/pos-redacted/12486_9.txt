H.G. ******* had difficulties working in France after he had made "** *******" in 1943 which was produced by the German company and later judged by French as a piece of anti-French propaganda. ***** ******, an admirer of Clouzot's work, invited him to direct a thriller "Quai des Orfevres" where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder that happened in Paris ***** ****. Without each other knowledge, the seductive cabaret singer ***** ******* (Suzy Delair) and her jealous piano-accompanist husband Maurice who is madly in love with her (******** *****, father of director ******** *****) trying to cover up (without each other's knowledge) what they believe to be their involvement in the murder? Enters tenacious policeman (***** ******) who is determined to discover the truth. Jouvet practically stole the movie with wonderfully cynic and sentimental in the same time performance. "His character, his eagle-like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres", witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great comeback of H.G. *******, the fine director, "French Hitchcock".
