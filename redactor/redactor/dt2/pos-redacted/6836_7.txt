This movie was a pleasant surprise for me. In all honesty, the previews looked horrible, up until the point where **** ******** and **** ******* appeared. So I rented it with reservation, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had great acting, a few good plot twists, and, of course, **** ******** and **** *******. It's definitely worth checking out.
