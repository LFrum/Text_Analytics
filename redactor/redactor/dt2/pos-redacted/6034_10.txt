After repeatedly saying how brilliant so many ******* episodes are, it's time to honour an episode with maximum points. "Etude In Black" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's certainly more than 90 percent...maybe 96 or 97! <br /><br />Last week I reviewed "Just Married" and compared it unfavourably to "Meet The Parents". Well here's one of the parents, ****** ******, in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor **** ********, played by the legend that is **** **********. **** has been having an affair with ******** *****, a girl in the orchestra (not his first affair, one suspects). She is blackmailing **** to leave his wife, but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra, **** doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide.<br /><br />Enter ******* and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for ******* to connect **** to the victim, and soon he's following him around wherever he goes. Even though ******* is certain **** is his man, it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads (none of which ******* really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some top-notch extra characters, ranging from the precocious young neighbour of ******** ***** and the English mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on Coronation Street, through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder (he had also been seeing ******** *****, the busy girl!). And there's even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. As with ****** ******* in "Lady In Waiting", it's impossible to take him seriously (I bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the podium, aren't you?!) <br /><br />But it's ****** ******, **** ********** and ***** **** who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as *** ********. From the moment she spots **** dialling ******** *****' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust **** despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. ******* doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about ****'s relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for **** **********, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as ******* villains, because he could have been up there with **** ******* and ******* ******** as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the "highly irritated" category, losing all patience with ******* rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge *******'s genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of **** ********** and ***** **** on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced ***** ****** watched this clip and based **** ********* on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing ** ******* You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while ****, ********** and their friend *** ******* fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between ***** **** and **** **********. It's clear to see from the quality of "Etude In Black" just how well the pair worked together!
