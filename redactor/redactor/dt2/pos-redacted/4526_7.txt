"Murder Over New York" is an entertaining entry in the ******* **** series of films, but if you're paying attention, a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye. While traveling to New York City for an annual police convention, **** (Sidney Toler) meets former Scotland Yard investigator **** ***** (********* *******) on the same flight. Now employed by military intelligence, ***** is tracking **** ***** and his ***** servant, suspected for acts of sabotage around the world. ***** believes that by contacting *****'s elusive wife, he'll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal.<br /><br />When ***** winds up dead in the library of ****** *****, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, ******* theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called "tetrogene", administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken. Summoning ***** to bring all of his dinner party guests together, **** and Police ********* ***** (****** ********) question those in attendance, as one of them may be the killer. Among them are ******* ****** (Melville Cooper), a fellow Oxford student of *****'s, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to ***** but requested by him to attend, ***** ***** (Kane Richmond), the chief designer at *****'s aircraft company, and ***** ******* (**** ******), *****'s stock broker. ***** butler ***** (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after Number #2 *** ***** (****** *** ****) catches him steaming open a cablegram, the contents of which concern ***** himself.<br /><br />There are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well. Mrs. ***** turns up as ******** **** (******** ******), and contrary to *****'s suspicion that she might lead him to *****, is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage. She's involved with ***** ******* (****** ******), principal of a chemical research firm, and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angle.<br /><br />As with many **** films, racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings. This one offers two glaring ones. When *****'s black servant is brought in for questioning, he states that he doesn't know anything about *****'s murder, that he's completely "in the dark". ****'s response: "Condition appear contagious".<br /><br />Later, following ********* *****'s order to round up all the *****'s in New York, ***** **** comments on their arrival with "They're all beginning to look alike to me." Actually, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie, as ***** ****** impersonates ***** mystic "The Great Rashid", but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist ****** McCoy.<br /><br />Before the movie's over, two more victims fall to the clever ***** - his confederate ********, and aircraft magnate ***** himself. To uncover the killer, ****, in concert with *******, arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before. Before it can release it's deadly poison, the Brit ****** catches the falling capsule in mid-air, revealing that he knew about the plant. Arrested and brought in for questioning, **** asserts that ****** is not *****. The real ***** reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous ******, anxious to maintain *****'s secret. But **** was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt, and reveals the real murderer - ***** now in the guise of stock broker *******, having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accident.<br /><br />Now for the plot holes. When first investigating **** *****'s murder, it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests. However *******/***** was present at the dinner party. It had already been established that ***** had one non party visitor in the library, chemist *******. If the fingerprints really did not belong to *****, then making them an issue was pointless.<br /><br />Also, at the end of the film when ***** offers ****** the poisoned water, how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness? But going even one better than that, how would a world traveling saboteur like ***** have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a New York City stockbroker, it just doesn't make sense. <br /><br />For trivia fans, a few more points bear mentioning. In the film, Number #2 *** ***** is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to "***'s" aid to solve the case. In the prior **** film - "******* **** at the Wax Museum" - ***** was a law student.<br /><br />The poison gas formula would get reworked in a later **** film, this time by ******** with ****** ******* in the **** role in "Docks of New Orleans". In that story, poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its' victims.
