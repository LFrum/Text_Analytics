**** talks through his punch lines. This spoils the joke, for those of you who haven't figured it out. His show is held in a micro sized studio for a reason, or two reasons -- the small amount of laughter will be amplified, and few want to see him. *********'s set is the polar opposite -- ** ******** would be proud and the balcony is always full.<br /><br />NBC, tacky NBC, will never get it. ******* ***** *******'s megalomaniacal enterprise continues to be all about the money. At least CBS has a bit of a family feel to it.<br /><br />**** collects cars, or is it stamps, while ********* races cars. The difference is informative.<br /><br />When I chatted I used to ask other chatters to email me if **** _ever_ said something that was funny. I never got a single email. ********* has superb timing. He also can re-use the most unfunny joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that night's show.<br /><br />********* has built other careers. **** is now well known and respected in his own musical right. Even ****'s other band members get recognition and career boosting. **** ********* has become a name America knows of. Even the businesses in the same block as the ** ******** theater get a boost. What has **** ever done for anyone else? Personally, I am glad that Dave moved and **** got the Carson gig. I never watched NBC shows before and had no reason to after.<br /><br />The Top Ten list is an American icon. So is *********. **** is a caricaturist's dream, nothing more.
