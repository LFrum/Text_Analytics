**** *********'s "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a reference to heroin addiction - something that must have been rather risky to film back in 1955, fifty years ago (the censors today STILL have a problem with drug content in films!).<br /><br />The lead role was originally offered to ****** ******, then snatched by ***** ******* before ****** could respond. Sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and ex-heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find himself battling the demons of temptation.<br /><br />********* is one of my favorite directors (his "Anatomy of a Murder" starring ***** ******* is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama). ********* pretty much helped change the face of cinema back in the '50s - "Anatomy of a Murder" was extremely controversial when it came out due to both its plot and content (references to rape, women's "panties," seduction, etc.) and "The Man with the Golden Arm" deals with a topic that is equally volatile.<br /><br />However, ********* pulls it off without becoming exploitative. This is like a forerunner to "The Panic in Needle Park" (1971) and bears more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs to the classic ***** ****** movie "Lost Weekend," starring *** *******. These three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today.
