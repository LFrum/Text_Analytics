****** is sent in his cage on a train by his old-lady owner. In the same baggage car, also in a cage, is *********. <br /><br />In no time, ********* has grabbed ****** but a trainman comes back and slaps the "sneakin' feline," as he calls him, back in his cage. He puts ****** "in a safer place," up high and tells the cat, "Now, remember: no tricks!" ********* puts his halo on and looks innocent. Yeah, right.<br /><br />I found the funniest stuff, however, didn't involve ********* versus ****** but the "viscious dog" that is in another cage next to *********. The cat gets mouthy with him, and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner. ********* just doesn't learn, but that's one reason we love him! (I know a number of IMDb reviewers don't like ****** but I like both main characters - they both crack me up!)<br /><br />Also, the train, and the passing scenery, is beautifully illustrated in here - really nice visuals.
