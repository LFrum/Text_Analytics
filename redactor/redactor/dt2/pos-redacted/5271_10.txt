Helges best movie by far. Very funny, very surrealistic. If ****** made a movie starring ****** ****** as Krusty the Clown it would look like this.<br /><br />Brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other Schneider movies, especially ****** ********* as the sidekick of 00Schneider. (******* ***** who once more plays the wife in this one is a bit annoying though). And of course Helge himself as ***** ****** is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />P.S: if this movie had a proper merchandising i would really like to buy a replica of that "Holz ist" painting.
