For only doing a few movies with his life the Late Great ***** ******. ****** died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in ***** ***, ***** *****. From the lame Police Academy 4 Spade really has done good with his career in films. ***** *** is a classic and we will always remember ***** ****** when we watch it. From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to doing ***** ***, ***** *****, ******** ***** *****, ****** ******, ***** *******, and ***** ****. I think ***** ****** had a short and successful career. ***** *** was his best in my case and I would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time. Thank you ***** ******.
