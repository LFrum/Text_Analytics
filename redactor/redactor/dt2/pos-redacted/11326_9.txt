I Feel the Niiiiiight Heat! I feel your HEEAAAAAAAAAART-beat! Something ain't right!" Theme song written by B.J. Cook from Skylark- ***** ******'s old band and wife. She also wrote the memorable theme from CBC's "Airwaves." OH ***** ****! What a program! Well-written, well-acted and totally classic. Crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end. I'd like to think this is really what detectives do/did. ******** was a real favourite! On a Canadian tip, I learned EVERY Canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on ***** ****. Everyone passed through the ***** **** set and like Law & *****, it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama.
