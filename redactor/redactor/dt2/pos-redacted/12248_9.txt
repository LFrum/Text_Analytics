I didn't like "As Good as it Gets" very much, but I am a big fan of ******* **** and ***** ******'s work, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of ****** ******. Here, in Spain, he's little-known, and only as a 2nd division version of ***** ***** in the West Coast. He played a great part, but ****** and **** were good too, specially ****, in an relatively unusual role for him. ****** played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in "Once Around" (***** *********, 1991).<br /><br />Finally, the rest of the cast is great, too. ****** Prosky, one of these familiar faces of the american cinema, the ex-bond girl **** ******, pretty good placed on that role, I think, the always perfect **** ****** in her early years; and specially the brief appereance of **** *********. Maybe he doesn't have any good scene, but it's **** *********, anyway... The Best movie by ***** ********, great story (well resolved), and superb cast for one of the, surely, best movies of the 80's
