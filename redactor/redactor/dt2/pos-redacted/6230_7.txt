"******* ****" is among my favorite late 70's/early 80's horror flicks. A group of young people are heading somewhere, one pair in the car ahead, & that car has a flat, and our film opens with the young man, *****, pushing the tire along looking for a service station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place, and yet hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. Along comes the rest of the young folks (in a VW Thing) and they pick up *****'s girlfriend, and find this very same place, *******'s *****, or some such thing..and then *** ******* happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream. Of course, the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that point, so odd *** ******* (***** *******) offers his help. *** ******* has a museum, with lots of wax figures, and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house, where he says ***** lives. And who is *****? Why, ***** ********, he says...but if it were ***** ********, they'd all probably be safer. The girls are left alone while ******* goes to help with fixing the car, but of course curiosity gets the better of one & she goes to investigate, and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named...*****. What follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one, they're taken prisoner by *****, who says he's *******'s brother. One girl (kidnapped earlier) is treated to a plaster facial, which results in her death when it covers up her air supply. At any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind (but weird) *** ******* is not exactly what he appears to be. A good, creepy late 70's horror flick, and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
