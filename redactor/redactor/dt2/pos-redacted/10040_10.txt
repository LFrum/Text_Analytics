Although "They Died with their Boots On" is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western. Not only is ***** the perfect Custer, the character actors are superb. Besides the action portion of the movie ***** and DeHavilland's love scenes are very touching and believable.(***** and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life). ***** was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!
