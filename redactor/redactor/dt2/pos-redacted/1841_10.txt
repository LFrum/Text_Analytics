I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. So charming and so very romantic. ***** ******** and Ms. Driver have chemistry that is so hot, you will need to take off a layer of clothing. The supporting cast is 100% top notch. Just watching ****** O'Connor and ****** ****** play off one another is pure poetry. ****** Hunt and *** ******** and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. Like *** ******* screaming at his children to go to sleep "FOREVER!" or him dancing in the kitchen. This film made we wish I knew people like that in my own life. Not to mention, what woman does not want ***** ******** for a boyfriend?
