The Standard bearer of all movie serials, the definite good guy - ***** ****** - versus *** *** - Ming the Merciless. Though the special effects seem awful by today's standards, for 1936 they were top notch. But the essence of the story is the battle between ******** ***** ****** (****** ******) versus ******* **** of Mongo (******* *********). ****** and Middleton are terrific in their parts. And the supporting characters playing **** *****, Dr. ******, Princess Aura, ****** *****, Vulcan, and the rest are all very good. This serial is far superior to the 1980 movie, basically because ****** is much much superior to *** ** ***** as ***** ******.<br /><br />This serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials. No question about it.
