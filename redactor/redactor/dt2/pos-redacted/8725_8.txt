Well I would say that this is a very enjoyable and somewhat touching movie despite its flaws. I didn't believe for a minute that ******* knew the first thing about being a dentist. Also, ****'s character seemed to recover from suicidal depression rather quickly at the beginning of the movie. Not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous. However, the film does succeed due to a good pace, humor, and its stars. ******* may not have been a dentist, but he was as amusing as he usually is. ******* brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where her and ******* go out for a drink after work) and also a good deal of humor. I believe it was her performance that made my brother take notice of this movie after overhearing a couple scenes. ****'s performance is noteworthy, although an Oscar may have been over doing it a bit. Basically, don't take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy yourself.
