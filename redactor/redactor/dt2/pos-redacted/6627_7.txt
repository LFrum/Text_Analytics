*****, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and wife named ***, and ***. They live on an island working as farmers. There is a war going on and soldiers start attacking people on the island. Once the war subsides a little ***, and *** are arrested as going along with the opposite side. Once released even more trouble ensues and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. Winner of The CEC Award for **** ******* **** at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards, The Guldbagge Award for **** ******* (*** ******, who plays ***) at The Guldbagge Awards, The NBR Award for **** ******* ******** **** and **** ******* at The National Board Of Review and The NSFC Award for **** *******, **** ******** (****** *******) and **** **** at The National Society Of Film Critics Awards. *****, has good direction, a good script, good performances by both Max Von Sydow (who plays ***) and *** ****** (who plays ***), good cinematography and good production design. *****, is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive. The film has a powerful message and is a good film. The reason I'am not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other ****** ******* films like **** ************, The Seventh Seal or Persona, for example. The film didn't have as big an impact on me as I thought it would and it lacked ****** *******'s thoughtful and philosophical dialog. While nowhere close to being one of his best films there is still a lot to like about *****, and it is a good movie. I just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other Bergman masterpieces.
