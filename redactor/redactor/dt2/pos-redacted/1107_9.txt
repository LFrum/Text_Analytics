UK-born Australian helmer **** ****** calls for attention with his strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning ****** **** (2006). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by ****** Film-Australia.<br /><br />**** (**** *********), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son ****** (******* *******) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of his deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and ****** check into a local hotel **** begins to question the locals about ***** ***'s death - some say that he committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Puzzled **** comes up with a theory of his own - ***** *** is alive and well, hiding in the nearby bushes.<br /><br />If not for the occasional lines of dialog used to ease its heavy atmospheric tone ****** **** could have been easily mistaken for a ******* film. Shot with a 16mm camera its washed-out color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective forays into human agony. Perhaps it isn't a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where ****** **** had its premiere.<br /><br />Looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture - while *******'s films tend to remain painfully intimate, to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director's preferred yellow, ****** **** very much feeds off the Australian countryside. ****'s gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of ******'s vision.<br /><br />In *******'s The Second Circle a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury his deceased father. In the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of his father in a coffin. Then he bids goodbye and buries it. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with.<br /><br />In ****** ****, somewhat ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary it is pain, loneliness, and dissatisfaction with "modernity" that suddenly invade ****'s life. Unlike The Second Circle however here the main protagonist has the opportunity to re-embrace his modern life. His wife and son await him, yet, he walks away. Slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past.<br /><br />I doubt ****** intended for ****** **** to be so strikingly similar to what ******* did in The Second Circle. Yet, the pacing, and in particular the puzzling framing, are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience - a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection.<br /><br />**** ********* delivers a top-notch performance as **** adding even greater depth to his highly challenging character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and ******* ******* match perfectly with their performances pic's tense visual style.
