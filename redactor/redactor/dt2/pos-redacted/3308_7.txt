A hugely enjoyable screen version of **** *****'s best-selling pot-boiler about the trials and tribulations, (and, naturally, the loves), of a group of women involved in one way or another in the New York publishing business. Directed by **** *********, fairly fresh from the success of "Three Coins in a Fountain", and the prototype for the likes of "Sex and the City", except that here the sex all takes place off-screen.<br /><br />The bright young female talents of the day, (Hope Lange, ***** *****, **** ******, ****** ****), are all nicely cast while **** ******** pops up as a Queen Bitch of an editor who could probably eat ***** ******'s Miranda Priestly and spit her out; with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie. The men include ******* ****, ***** *******, (if it wasn't ******* ****** it had to be ***** *******), ****** *****, (before he decided, wisely, to go behind the camera) and ***** ******. There are more suds on display than you will find in your average launderette but if, like me, you enjoy "Desperate Housewives", not to mention ****** ******** and company then you will probably love this. A very guilty pleasure.
