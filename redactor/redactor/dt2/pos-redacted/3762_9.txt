In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was "The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the "****'s Got Nothing to Hide" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. ***** Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. *** ***** has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit. **** Blankfield reminds one of Gene Wilder in some ways. **** ********* was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.
