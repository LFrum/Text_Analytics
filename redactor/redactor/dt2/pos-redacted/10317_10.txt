Not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted, I will only say this: <br /><br />Nearly everybody says they loved ***** best... but I will put BRIDELESS GROOM up against ANY of other the Stooges shorts. <br /><br />I think it's the most hilarious from start to finish, as well as being the most re-watchable.<br /><br />The off-key singing student... ********* ********'s "****** *****" routine, and of course **** *****'s J.P. are highlights, but only around the Stooges' impeccable timing and the great writing too!<br /><br />**** said.
