The Andrew Davies adaptation of the ***** ******' novel was excellent. The characters of *** and and ***** were superbly portrayed by ******* ******** and ****** ***** respectively. The whole series was a total joy to watch. It caught the imagination of everyone across the board, whether straight or gay. I wish there could be a sequel!
