This as the first of the Ma and ** ****** flicks. ******** Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see *** ***** as *****, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in "Desk Set" and "****** ********* Presents". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that ** doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in "Nanny & the Professor". Unfortunately he died real young... oddly enough, his last role was on the series "***** ******". weird. Directed by ******* ******, who not only directed several of the Kettle films, he also did a bunch of the Abbott and Costello flicks, so he must have known a thing or two about comedy. Fun story, plain, simple humor. Even the release date was April ****'s day, 1949. The story starts out by showing us what backward and country-folk they are (the neighbors are even Native Americans), but as the story progresses, we have sympathy and respect for them.
