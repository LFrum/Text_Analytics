Gerald McRaney,(**** ******),"War Crimes",'01 TV Series, was like a father to ******* ********,(******** Gallagher),"A Kiss Before Lying",'03, who experience a very bad situation in her life and it caused ******** to be withdrawn with people and young men. **** ****** tries desperately to get her out of the house and manages to introduce ******** to ***** (Gallagher) who falls madly in love with her at their very first meeting. In almost one or two dates later, ***** asks ******** if she will marry him and she agrees. It is not very long after the Wedding that things start to happen, ***** is in the Navy and does not like working in submarines and things start happening to young gals in the neighborhood. This is a very excellent TV film and it sometimes makes you wonder if the guy or gal I want as a Soul Mate is the Perfect PERSON !
