Continuing his comeback, **** ******** played a mildly twisted angel in "*******". He may be a messenger of God, but he's not the nicest guy, as reporters ***** MacDowell and ******* **** discover. When I first saw this movie, it was before I had started watching "All in the Family", so I didn't recognize **** ********* as ***** ******. Now that I recognize her like that, I try to imagine ****** snapping at her for harboring an angel (whom he would probably rank alongside blacks, ****, etc).<br /><br />I know, that doesn't really relate to the movie. But I just like to associate things that way. Anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. Also starring *** *******, **** **** and ******* ****** *<br /><br />What **** and **** said...
