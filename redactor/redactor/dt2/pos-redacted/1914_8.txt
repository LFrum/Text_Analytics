Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring **** *** ***** as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way. He has two enemies, that no good ****** ***** and the sleazy mayor. ***** ******** kick, punch, slap and pimp his way across the screen. What's the man's name? DOLEMITE!<br /><br />Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, **** *** ***** made several on the cheap films during the seventies. **** produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience. Some people call it blacksploitation others call it trash, I call it entertaining. ******** was followed by the semi-sequel The Human Tornado and a direct to video ****** of ******** 25 years later.<br /><br />****** recommended, a definite cult classic! <br /><br />Footnotes, if the film was properly matted on video you wouldn't see the boom mikes. ******** was cut to receive an R-rating.
