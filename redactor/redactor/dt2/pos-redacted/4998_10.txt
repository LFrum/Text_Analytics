I must have seen a different version than the first person on the user comments section.<br /><br />It's really, really good...***** **** and **** ***** are great together. *** Kilmer's character is much like he was in the novel, although the emphasis is on Gus and **** and the Comanches. We get to see what happened with **** and Newt's mother as well. I won't spoil it, but it gives a lot of insight into ****'s character.<br /><br />All the actors did a really convincing job. ***** **** had the biggest challenge, I thought, to follow ****** ******! There's a lot of action, humor, tragedy. It's got something for everyone. I can't wait until it airs, my family are all jealous I got to see it early!
