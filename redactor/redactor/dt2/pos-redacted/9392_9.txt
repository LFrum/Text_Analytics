****** ***** is a genius. "Death Bed: The Bed That ****" is a prototype for much of the 'slipstream' fiction and camp surrealism that is so chic now. Truly innovative, maverick, and just effing brilliant. Hyper-strange acting, subtly nightmarish atmosphere. I recommend reading ******* *******'s book "********* ***" (there is a chapter devoted to ***** and "Death Bed: The Bed That ****"). Available from FAB Press. On a related note, "Death Bed: The Bed That ****" and "****** *****'s Door" make a perfect double-bill. Furthermore, it's trite and tired - and ultimately stupidly ironic - to criticize a low-budget cult film for being 'poorly made' or 'technically inept.' The B-movie aesthetic is part of these films' charm. No amount of CGI could duplicate the cumulative effect "Death Bed: The Bed That ****" has on the viewer with an advanced palate.
