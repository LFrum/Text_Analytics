"What ***** Found" is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard of it, and I though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. They say all indie movies suck, but this one, and "******** ********" didn't suck. I asked my friend, who'd seen it before I did, and she said that ***** has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that I remember, and little nudity. The movie did have a point, and it taught me never trust hitchhikers. I liked that in the end, they got ***** a little dolphin In the end, on her way to Flordia. I totally suggest seeing this movie.
