I viewed *****, and it is a Top-Rate Movie! The lives of **** and his wife, *****, who he adored as a young man and finally married. They meet another married couple, **** and ******, and the foursome become very good friends. But, their friendship takes a Twisted Turn after vacationing together at Varona Beach....A Twist that never returns the married couples to their former status as friends.<br /><br />***** is A Must-See!!!! The acting by Virginia Madsen is acceptable; however, ******* ****** steals the movie with his incredible acting...and the emotions that he displays.<br /><br />A Wonderful Movie! "***** *****"
