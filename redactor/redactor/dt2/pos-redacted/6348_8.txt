Let me say first off that I am a huge fan of the original series ******** **** and the book it was based from. I have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews I'd heard about it. If ***** *** ***** wasn't playing Capt. Call I didn't see the point. If ***** ******** wasn't involved why should I care? How wrong I was.<br /><br />This is in so many ways a worthy sequel to ******** ****, maybe even more so than the dark mood of Streets Of Laredo. The story, acting, production, cinematography are all top-notch. Of course the script isn't as colorful as ******** **** but it has it's moments. And, much to my surprise, there are bits of Lonesome Done in this series; the relationship between July and *****, completely dismissed in the prequel, is brought up here almost identical to the book, a most welcome surprise. The story isn't all roses, it has it's surprises too. By far the biggest surprise is *** ******'s interpretation of Capt. Call. While not a direct copy of ***** *** *****' his is both faithful and unique to ******'s credit. The cast is fantastic all across the board, and I don't think **** ********* has done a better job of acting than in this series. ****** Reed practically steals the show here, he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him.<br /><br />It is worth it to watch this if you haven't due to bad criticisms, especially that the DVD is so affordable (I got the 2-disc set for $10.99, you can probably find it cheaper). It is in no way the disappointment that **** ***'s **** turned out (well, it was for me). And MCMurtry was involved with that one!
