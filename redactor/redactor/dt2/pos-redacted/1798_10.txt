Happy 25th Birthday to ****** ****! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances...captures the spirit of the 80's; the slang of the mainstreams and the outcasts. A wonderful rendition of high school life and "gritty downtown" from a suburban perspective.<br /><br />The soundtrack contains songs by ****** *******, ******, ***** ******, Sparks, ******$, ***** ******, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, *** At Work, The Flirts and Bananarama.<br /><br />This movie truly is ***** and *****t (minus the double suicide) set in 1980's Los Angeles. *****'s dad, played by ******** ******* (***** ****, anyone?) is hysterical as a hippie idealistic dad who wonders how he sprung such a materialistic offspring. Yet, he doesn't judge, ya dig??
