Forget ***** ******* reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and ********'s other great Christmas story, "Meet **** ***" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name.<br /><br />******** plays a food writer for a McCall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. She's an ace b.s. artist until the day ******'s sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a Navy hospital. Released the last year of WWII, the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality. ******** is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky ****** with whom it's love at first sight. Unfortunately, she has to play married to ********'s prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in CT, just to fool her boss.<br /><br />S.Z. Sakall adds a great deal of Hungarian malaprop & double-entendre humor in support as ****' true source of culinary talent & *** O'Connor is hilarious as ********'s obnoxious Irish housekeeper.
