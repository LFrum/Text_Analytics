Paha maa is different Finnish film. But the things which makes it different are copied abroad. Some techniques of narration are from ****** ******, ****** ***** and Elephant. Scenes are shot from different angles again. Paha maa is a good movie, but it isn't so good that the hype tolds: "Realistic movie, no happy end, and no commercial admissions." Some actors did great job. ****** ******* was so good as a vacuum cleaner peddler. Also ****** ********* shows his skills. But ***** ********** was so lame. He is so overrated actor, he's handsome and a nice guy, but not the best actor of Finland. But if you like Finnish movies, Paha maa is worth to see.
