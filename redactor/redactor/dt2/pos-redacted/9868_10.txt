Halloween:The Curse Of ******* ***** is probably the best sequel out of all of the Halloween flicks. *****, serial killer ******* *****' niece, bears a baby who is then taken by the Man In Black from the conclusion of Halloween 5. A kind nurse helps ***** escapes but ***** quickly tracks her down and kills her. *****'s baby is found and rescued by ***** *****, one of the kids ***** *** babysat in the original film, and ***** arrives in Haddonfield and begins to kill off the Strode clan living in his old house. The film concludes with scenes revealing clues to *******'s evil, the identity of the Man In Black, and a close to the whole Dr. Loomis/******* ***** storyline. I highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece.<br /><br />Halloween:The Curse Of ******* ***** is Rated R for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, brief sexuality, language, and brief nudity.
