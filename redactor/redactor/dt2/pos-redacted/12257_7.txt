Good drama/comedy, with two good performances from Hunter & ****, but ****** ****** steals every scene he is in. With a great script, this movie soars and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent. And although **** ****** is not in this much, but she has one if not the funniest scene in the movie. The highlight of the movie for me, was ****** ****** speech on the devil. Only one draw back is the fact it goes little slow in places. And I only got totally interested in Brooks role, not so much in Hunter's or ****'s. I give this a 7 out of 10.
