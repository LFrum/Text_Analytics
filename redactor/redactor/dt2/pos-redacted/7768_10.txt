Late film critic **** ****** said that this movie shows how easy it is to make a movie. He was giving it a compliment even though now that might have been taken as an insult these days. Even though I didn't always agree with **** ******, I agree with him here. **** ***** is a shining example of how a love story should be: realistic with real characters in real situations.<br /><br />The story chronicles the ups and downs of the relationship between ****** ********(****** ****) and Nina(*** ****). ****** **** and *** **** are more than just a beautiful couple on screen. These two actually have chemistry together. You can feel the vibe between these two whenever the are on screen and its fantastic.<br /><br />**** ******* is pretty funny as the deceitful **** and **** ****** ****** is great as Nina's friend Simone. ****** Washington is just as great as ******'s close friend ***** and I sigh every time I see him in a movie. The guy is a great actor whose career is ruined by industry lowlifes and the childish games they play. You can believe that he called the little weasel on Grey's Anatomy out of his name but anybody that knows how ********* works knows better than to believe any "official story" from the place of make believe. At any rate...<br /><br />**** ***** is a wonderful love story full of interesting and likable characters that are in realistic situations that anybody that has been in love can relate too. You love these people because they are believable and are not portrayed as gangsters and tramps. Not one obscene stereotype can be found here. Contrast that with the Romance movies of toady. Exactly. In closing if you love ***** ****** then you would do well to own a copy of this movie.
