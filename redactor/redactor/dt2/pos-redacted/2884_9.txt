In dramatising *****'s novel, **** ******* has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. ***** and ****** ***** ********* lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to *********'s "Dr. Jekyll and *** ****", but note that ***** chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route. Both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end.<br /><br />The actors in this BBC movie, take a different route, too, from those in the 1945 film. **** ******* says all the same caustic and cynical quips as ****** *******, in his role really projecting ***** himself, but with a subtle difference. You'll suspect that ******* really believed what he was saying, but ******* may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. ***** Firth, too, shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion, but then we don't get to see as many of his escapades as **** ******** had a chance to display.<br /><br />It's a very good production, with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel, if not all of its ramifications.
