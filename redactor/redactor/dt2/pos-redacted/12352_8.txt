Pistol-packing *** ***** takes names and kicks butt as the heroine in "Asylum of Satan" director ******* *******'s entertaining blaxploitation actioneer "***** ****," co-starring D'Urville ****** and ****** ******. "***** ****" is one of several tough chick flicks that ***** appeared in during the 1970s, including "*****," "**** *****," and "Friday Foster." The short-lived ******* co-wrote this thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer ***** ******* in one night and it features a headstrong female shamus that refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business. Unfortunately, "***** ****" isn't nearly as good as the blaxploitation movies that ***** made under the supervision of director **** ****. **** helmed the African-American North Carolina native in "*****," "**** *****," "The Big Bird Cage," and "The Big Doll House." Anybody that analyzes images of African-American women in cinema should be familiar with these epics. The chief problem with "***** ****" is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks. Naturally, the secondary villains are trigger happy clowns that couldn't hit the side of a barn with a howitzer. As the main antagonist, **** ********** qualifies as both an egotistical as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like: "Anything worth having is worth stealing." Additionally, composer **** ******* does provide a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with ******* ***** warbling it, is "Good Man Is ****." "***** ****" casts ***** as stylist Chicago gumshoe ***** ******. She leaves the Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, ********, to help out her father. When she arrives in Louisville, ***** learns that her father, **** (Rudy Challenger of "Detroit 9000"), is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed ***** (cigar-chomping D'Urville ****** of "Hammer") who demands that **** sell out his loan company to ***** or die.<br /><br />Initially, ***** dispatches a goon squad to trash ****'s office, but our heroine's father catches them in the act. They turn *****'s father into a punching bag. Interestingly, during the fight scene, ******* rarely shows fists smashing flesh. Earlier, ****'s right-hand man, ***** ******** (****** ****** of "****** ****"), had sent ***** a telegram requesting that she return to Louisville, but she didn't receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didn't know where to find her. Brick and ***** hook up, rekindle their romantic flames, and share a night in the sack. Brick spends most of his time urging ***** to remain calm in the face of adversity. As a former Louisville, ********, police woman, ***** prefers to shoot first and ask questions second. After she arrives home, ***** borrows her father's car and barely escapes being blown to bits. As she is walking out the door to get into her father's car, **** receives another harassing call from *****. Previously, **** had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to *****, but **** changes his mind and agrees to talk with the hoodlum. A gratified ***** warns **** about the dynamite that has been attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse. In other words, cranking up the car won't trigger the explosion; the explosion comes ten seconds later. **** and Brick rescue ***** before the car blows up. Earlier, ***** had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her interference. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I'm not going to sit on the sidelines just because I'm a woman," ***** tells him. After her near-death experience, ***** vows to learn who sabotaged her father's car. She grilles an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information. Only after ***** has ground the guy's face into a bucket of chlorine dust does he relent and tell her about a pay-off at the town's railroad museum. Brick accompanies ***** and shooting ensues with a flustered ***** getting away by the skin of his chin.<br /><br />Later, ***** sends a quintet of out-of-town contract thugs armed-to-the-teeth to trash ****'s office. These gunsels ignore their no-kill orders. Not only do they shoot the loan company office to ribbons, but they also blast *****'s dad with a shotgun. ***** retaliates in short order. Wielding her nickel-plated revolver, she guns down three of the four assailants ***** ***** style. The last hit-man discards his weapon and pleads for mercy. ***** has her finger on the trigger when ******** ********* **** ******* (******* ********* of "Abby") and a uniform cop arrive on the scene. At the hospital, **** ****** dies holding his daughter's hand. Naturally, ***** is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy. *********, ***** tracks down a loan shark, Walker (*********** *** of "********* *****"), and pries information out of him about the ***** while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash. This is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment whirling and humming. Walker warns ***** about *****. ***** and his henchmen confront ***** in a parking lot and swap lead. ***** flees on foot to a nearby carnival. While the police corner one of *****'s men, she deals with the others. ***** shoots one of his own accidentally and ***** runs him down. She pins ***** to a roller-coaster track and threatens to hold him there until the roller-coaster cuts his head off. ***** manages to escape after he has spilled his guts to ***** about the identity and phone number of the big man, Shark (**** ********** of "The Hellcats"), whose reputation is so immaculate that ********* ******* describes him as "the guy with all the right answers." "***** ****" isn't top-notch *** *****. However, the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick.
