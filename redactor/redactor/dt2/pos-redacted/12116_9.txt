This was a great anime. True the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than ***** ******, the problem that it was kinda long.<br /><br />Japanese movie star ******** ****** who played **** from Last ******* played the main character **** and it was directed by ******* who did ****** ******* 999 and Metropolis.<br /><br />The anime has some good animation for an old anime, interesting characters like the main villain ****** and **** ******* and of course lets not forget the beautiful musical scores in the film.<br /><br />All in all this movie is worth watching for fans of anime, animation in general, action, and *******/Ninja flicks. Despite the lows in the film that didn't the film from being a great film to watch.<br /><br />Don't miss this film.
