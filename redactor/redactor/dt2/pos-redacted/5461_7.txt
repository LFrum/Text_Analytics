THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting made for HBO movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between ***** ********* and *** **** when ****** ****** announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This struggle is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where ********* is now, it might be interesting to learn that ***** ********* wanted to replace ****** ****** as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world, but ********* found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host **** had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, ***** ********, in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job. It's not often that we get to see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value, but for fans of these two late night superstars, this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television. According to this movie, ********* was practically promised the job by ****** himself while NBC had promised the job to **** and that's where ***** ******** came in. The movie presents **** as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by ******** and feigned ignorance to some of *****'s strong-willed manipulations of some of NBC's biggest power players and it presents ********* as this smart and savvy businessman who, despite having ******'s support, was railroaded by NBC and ********. **** ******* ******* and ****** ******* credibly recreate ********* and ****, respectively, but it is the razor-sharp performance of Oscar winner ***** ***** as ***** ******** that keeps this movie bubbling. Bates commands the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast. There is also a wonderful turn by impressionist **** ****** as ****** ******, but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by Bates that make this one worth checking out.
