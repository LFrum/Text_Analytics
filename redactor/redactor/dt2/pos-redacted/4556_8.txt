A kinda remake of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES in a lot of ways.i think,i think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that both **** ***** and ***** ****** left us When they still had a lot of stuff to do.God bless them both,i think the plots of 2 movies are really similar,**** ***** of two different poles of characters,and a lot of unlucky consequences because of the Chubbies, This movie can not be Planes trains and Automobiles but its a really entertaining movie especially with the great performance of ***** ******, The missing part in this movie is the touchy stuff if we compare it with *****&****** *******,but i think its better this way
