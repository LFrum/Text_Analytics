***** ******** was one of the most imaginative (and among the funniest) of all the silent-film comedians. Why is he utterly forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the *** warehouse burnt in the early 1930s. ******** was not handsome or graceful like *******, ****** and *****; nor was he dapper, like ******* ********. And unlike ***** ******* and (again) *******, ******** did not try for audience sympathy.<br /><br />However, his films were hugely popular at the time of their original release, and they remain hilarious today. ***** ****** once claimed that he asked ******* if there was any other comedian whom he'd ever envied, and ******* instantly named ***** ********. The character most frequently portrayed by ******** on screen -- a flat-capped naff, with fastidious hand gestures and a duck-like walk -- was later adapted by vaudeville comedian ***** **** (**** ****'s father), and further adapted by ****** ******* as his 1950s TV character 'The **** Soul'.<br /><br />'The ******', directed pseudonymously by ****** ********, is one of ********'s most innovative shorts, and it's hilarious. We first see him as a country boy, bidding farewell to his family outside their homespun cottage, on his way to the big city. Then he steps away from the cottage, and we see that it's IN the big city, with traffic booming all round him!<br /><br />Eventually, our hero ends up at a restaurant (uncredited, but it's the Montmartre Cafe in downtown L.A.) where all the movie actors eat between takes. There's an amusing gag when ********'s bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and makeup as Presidents Washington, ******* and *********: this gag would have been funnier if the impostors looked more like the originals. Finally, our lad seats himself at a table, hoping to meet a celebrity. Sure enough, entering the restaurant and sitting at the very next table is a big movie star ... none other than ***** ********! There's a very well-made double-exposure shot -- the join is nearly invisible -- when ***** ******** as himself greets ***** ******** as the country boy.<br /><br />Sadly, ********'s peak period of creativity was very brief. He began his film career in crude slapstick films as one half of a double act (Ham and ***, opposite *** Duncan), and had a brief and blazing period of stardom in shorts during the late silent period. Sound movies were not kind to ********, and he was quickly shoved down the cast list in some crude early talkies. Then he died young. Fortunately, 'The ******' is quite funny, and a splendid introduction to this unique comedians' style. I'll rate it 7 out of 10.
