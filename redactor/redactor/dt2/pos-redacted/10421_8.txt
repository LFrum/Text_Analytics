I agree with the Aussie's comments for the most part. However, there id seem to be a fairly decent plot, if unoriginal. ********* (***** *******) inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge. She gets reacquainted with Chip (***** ********) whom she had known when she was growing up in there. The plot thickens when ***** (**** *****) arrives with his new stripper friend, Shene (Devinn Lane) because ********* had been *****' stripper friend in years gone by, and the implication is that ***** had done her wrong somehow. To add interest to the movie ****** **** (Monique Parent) a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge, as do Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), pair of lawyers from the city. ***** sicks the local building codes inspector on *********'s business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. So the question is, "How far will ***** go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?"<br /><br />Watch for Devinn Lane here and in "****** ********." She seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the "R" world. Another notable is ******** *********, playing the role of "Bait," clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies!
