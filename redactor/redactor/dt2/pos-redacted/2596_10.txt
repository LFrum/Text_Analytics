***** *****'s 'Rabbit Seasoning', the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, I would have to concede that 'Rabbit Seasoning' is the most finely honed script. Here, the emphasis is placed on language as **** and ***** run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abbot and ********'s 'Who's on next' routine. As a long term ***** fan, I have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently ***** who gets all the best lines (the famous "Pronoun trouble" being one of the all time classics) and does most of the work. **** plays the role of cool manipulator while *****, as always, is the befuddled dupe. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that ***** and ***** pose so little threat to **** that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. ***** falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old ***** who comes off worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions. It all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration "You're despicable". As intricate an example of ***** *****'s impeccable timing as you'll come across, 'Rabbit Seasoning' is a true classic.
