A light, uplifting and engaging movie. Watching ***** ***** is a delight! As you watch her, she ceases to be ***** ***** and becomes in every way ***** Wharton.<br /><br />I have enjoyed ***** ***** in every movie that I have seen and that would be nearly all of them. What a shame that most of her movies need restoration so badly. I do hope ***** ***** movie are restored before it is too late they are such treasures Thank goodness this is not the case with Over 21.<br /><br />It is a must see if you like superb acting and witty comedy with serious overtones. I agree with a previous comment on the speech "The World and ***** ***" it was one of the many highlights of the movie. I read somewhere that ***** ***** helped in writing that speech along with ******** ***** (***** ***** was a very good and charitable person in private life) and it certainly seems to show through in her movies!
