Anastasia: The Mystery of **** was a two-part star studded historical T.V. movie based on the ***** ***** book, Anastasia: The Riddle of **** ********. It keeps up historically pretty much, names are changed etc. But sticks to the real story quite well. **** Sharif and ****** ***** do quite well as the Russian royals, **** ******** and ******* *********. What stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by *** ******** and ****** ** *********. All in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting. I was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on NBC in late 1986. Also starring was the fine German actor *** ****** who had previously starred in NBC's other Russian epic "Peter the Great". <br /><br />I felt that Part 2 skipped over some important details of **** ********'s trip to America. It's important to know too, that in 1986 less was known about the **** ******** story. Back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. By the late 1990's more was known and **** ******** is now reputed to have been a fraud. <br /><br />Too bad the networks aren't making fine made-for-television movies like this anymore.
