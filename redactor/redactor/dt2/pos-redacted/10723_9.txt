**** was going great for New York City advertising artist *** ******. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife wasn't so loving, for when *** returned home late from work that night his wife, ******, had a suit case packed and was heading out the door. He tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and out of ***'s life. Well, now in addition to his job he's now got to mind the house as well as their 6-year-old son, *****; *** assured his boss that his wife's leaving would not affect his job performance in any way. It did however affect his performance as a father. He blew up when ***** spilled punch on his client artwork! Well, some time later *** and ***** receive a letter from ******, and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn't coming back. *** was distraught. Well, he was late coming home from work on *****'s birthday, which made ***** sore at him. <br /><br />*** was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting. When he got home, he yelled at ***** for sneaking ice cream during dinner. Then later he truthfully told ***** that the break-up between he and ****** may have been his fault, not *****'s; *** invited a good friend, ******* ******* over that night, and well, ***** got his first look at a naked woman. When *** took ***** to the park the following day, he fell off the jungle gym and landed face-first onto his toy plane. *** literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches. After that, life began taking a downward spiral for ***. Then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than ******! They met in a corner caf√©. At first they have a pleasant conversation but then ****** informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her. *** would have none of it and stormed out. Well life got even worse for *** when his boss, *** ********, took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him. Not only that but ****** was choosing to sue for custody of *****, and without a job, *** didn't stand a chance in hell for winning. He hired himself a lawyer, **** *********, who charged a pretty penny: $15,000 exact change. And that's IF they win. <br /><br />*** was also able to find a new job. It was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination. Finally the court date, January 9, 1980, arrived. Judge Atkins presiding. ****** took the stand and ********* proceeded to question her about why she left *** and about her other relationships and how they were failures. The next day, *** took the stand and ******'s lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger. ***'s good friend ******** took the stand as well and she really didn't help matters. Well, the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough, one day ********* informs *** that he lost. ****** got sole custody of *****. How typical! Always ruling in favor of the mother. Well, *** and ***** were just devastated about parting ways. They had a tearful goodbye when suddenly ****** stopped by. She and *** have a little talk and well, rather than just give away the ending, let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody!<br /><br />This was a very good movie. ****** ******* was very good. He earned that ******* *****. I've also seen him in Hook, Meet the Fockers and **** ***, which he also won an Oscar for. ***** ****** was good. She also got an Oscar. ****** ***** was good too, so where was his nomination? I guess the Academy had a rule against giving ****** to children, but the rule was lifted when ***** **** ****** came along. This movie has great drama, light comedy, and is very subtle. It does a good job of holding your attention. I was watching **** *** on TCM the other night then this came on after and I just couldn't help but watch. And that's what you should do. If you like ****** ******* or ***** ****** or movies of this genre, then I recommend ****** vs. ******! A gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child. I liked ***'s little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time. What was it about sex that makes a good parents? Actually, that's how they have the child. But seriously, he's right. Why always rule in favor of the mother because she's a woman? Also in the cast, ****** ***, ****** ****, who passed away in 1990, and ******* *********** who passed away in 1984. Watch for an up-and-coming JoBeth Williams in the nudity in the hallway scene. Anyway, see ****** vs. ****** today!!! Good movie!!<br /><br />-
