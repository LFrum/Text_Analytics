It's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those loopy **** ****** comedies made by ****** ***** *******, and while I prefer there other more bizarre, out-there flick, ****** *** ****, it's hard for me to dislike One Crazy Summer, a movie I grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens. OCS was a follow-up to ****** *** ****, returning ****** and ****** ********* from that film. <br /><br />****** is *****, following graduation pal **** ******(******)to Nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach. ***** finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde, buff punk named ***** ********** whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. One of the homes, needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to **** *****(*********). There's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving *********'s grandfather's home(..he had recently passed), but it has been won by ***** over the past many years, and ***** is deathly afraid of boats over water. But, with the help and motivation of newfound Nantucket friends(..such as ****** ******** and *** ******* as auto-mechanic twin brothers!), ******, and budding love-interest *********, perhaps ***** can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. Armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky, manic weapons salesman, General Raymond(..SCTV's *** ******** in an inspired bit of casting), ***, who uses the training from his father to assist ***** and company in their goals to win the race. <br /><br />Memorable scenes include ****** getting stuck in a Godzilla suit(!)running rampant across an entire model of ******* **********(**** *******, barely recognizable as *****'s rather unhinged pops)'s condominium, ***** being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid, ****** a victim of toxic flatulence, ***** ******'s nutty ***** *****'s increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show, and the wonderful ****** **** as ******'s grandma who actually bills the group after a meal! ****** Piven as(you guessed it)a brutish jerk who associates with ***** and causes trouble for ***** and his posse, the yummy ******** ****** as Cookie(..*****'s girl who attempts to make-out with ***** while he attends a luncheon with his father), and the one-and-only ******* ****** as Old Man Beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race. **** ***** is cute, but this is ******'s vehicle, though ****** and ******* steal most of the scenes their in. Again, some delightful animation from Holland are sprinkled throughout the movie(***** is an artist, appropriately). If you like his movies, I highly recommend the underrated, How I Got Into College.
