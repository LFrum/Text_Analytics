The Violent Men is pretty good western that certainly benefits from its excellent cast.<br /><br />****** ** ******** is the big rancher trying to squeeze out the smaller ranchers one of whom is ***** ****. Ford is ready to sell to appease his fiance (May Wynn) until ********'s ambitious brother (***** *****) murders one of Ford's hands. Then you know what happens next.<br /><br />******* ******** is along as ********'s scheming wife the kind of role in which she specialized. ****** ****** plays their daughter who comes to admire Ford.<br /><br />The Violent Men is nothing more than a "B" plot with an "A" movie cast but it is very well done.
