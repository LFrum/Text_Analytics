I was surprised by how great ***** ***** **** turned out to be.Being a fan of Christina ***** and ****** ** ******* id figure id give this a try.Well when this was over I was just left stunned by how great this film truly was.I mean everything was dead-on great and very accurate for that matter.This film shows how the great director and writer ***** ******(who made ****** & **** another great film) can just take anything even something that seems ludacras and make it into this.Well, I like how it is just a good time, like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way.Also I love that it doesn't show big steroeypes of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very reconisable.The cating in this was just phenomenal especially from Christina *****(who deserves an Oscar for this role), the always great ****** ** *******, and even ****** ********** did a great job as well.Overall almost everything is great about this, and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time. Three Cheers For ***** ***** ****!!!!<br /><br />9.3 out of 10 stars
