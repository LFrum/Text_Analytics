While it's not "perfect", it's close. **** ******* ********, SZ Sakall, ****** ***********, ****** ******, ****** ****** (Superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix, and the judge......I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! "The baby swallowed the watch" was always my son's favorite line.<br /><br />Sexy ******* ******** in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny S. Z. Sakall. ****** ****** has a few great songs, too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah).
