Over the weekend i watched the movie Tipping the Velvet and if I was to have to score this movie out of 100 I would have to give it 100 no question asked. I am a true believer in true love and this movie moved me in alot of different ways and the actors fit the parts without a doult. But I have to say that the ending was not so great for I did not see that spark in *****s eyes when ever she looked into ***'s eyes, as her eyes sparked each time she looked at *****, ***** only had to be in the room or in *****'s thought and ***** would just glow fron that spark. ***** told ***** that she could not find her and that she looked for her, but could not find her. ***** was ready to give it all up to get ***** back. In *****'s eyes you could see *****'s pain. I believe that ***** should have let ***** see that thier love is true and strong and that she would not let her go that easy. You need to make a part two and have the two make it together, but you must not let anyone else play the roles it has to be the real ***** & ***** or it'll never work. My mother once told me that true love is just not real. I am no fool I know that we all have a true love out someplace just waiting for each of us and I believe with my life that *****'s true love really is only ***** and *****'s true love is only *****. Come on lets play the game the right way, the only way. Let *****'s eyes shine again.... ***** lost her everything, by losing *****. And ***** is not to be the only one to blame. I am gay myself and being gay is not easy!! WAKE UP!!! in 1889 I'd not want to be gay, ***** was lost deep inside herself and in 1889 maybe the right thing to do was to be married to a man. Even though you love a woman. ***** needed ***** to stand up to her needed ***** to fight for her. Myself I remember how deeply I loved this girl and I let her get away because I thought I was doing something wrong and I went back to my ex-boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know I was wrong to let go of her and I will pay for the rest of my days,for like ***** I could not find her anyplace. I heard that she is married to a man in the U.S.A someplace. I even heard that he beats her. I guess in the end we both lose. Give the two girls one more chance life can be very lonely if you are not true to you and your loved one.<br /><br />Thank You, ******* ***
