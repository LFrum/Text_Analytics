This indie film is worth a look because of the enormous talent of its creators, ******* ********** and ****** ******. ** * Wolodarsky has directed the young cast, and he is to be praised for this effort.<br /><br />The premise of the film is a cautionary tale of the danger for wanting something one can't have. Which is the story of ***** and **. After living together for a while, ***** suddenly gets restless because she imagines she's lacking experience in the sex area. ***** and **'s relationship, while not an example of ideal happiness, is a comfortable way to share their lives with one another. That is, until the moment ***** and ******, her sister, happened to bump into a sexual encounter by another couple that has no clue of being observed.<br /><br />This incident makes ***** reevaluate her own sexual life with **; she finds it lacks substance. When she proposes 'seeing other people', ** is shocked, to put it mildly, but not wanting to contradict *****, he decides to go along. What happens next is that both ***** and ** enter into a world that's been unknown to them. The people they meet, in the end, are not worth the trouble. They sadly realize at the end, they were made for each other.<br /><br />The film is worth watching in order to see the amazing Julianne *********, who we happen to have liked in another indie film, "Tully". Ms. ********* reminds us of a young ******* *******; she projects such a luminous quality about her, that is hard to take one's eyes from her whenever she is in a scene. This young actress proves she is an accomplished performer who gets better with each new appearance. Basically, she carries the movie. Her ***** is a study in contrasts. ***** is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate in pleasing ** because of her inexperience.<br /><br />Jay Mohr, is an excellent match for Ms. *********. Both do wonders together. His ** is perfectly credible. We have known people like him. Deep down inside, he is a good person, who suddenly gets himself in a situation he didn't call for, yet, he goes along only to discover he is too decent and not cut out for a life of gratuitous sex with the willing women that have no problem with a tumble in the hay, just for fun.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is wonderful. ****** ****** does some amazing work as ******, *****'s yuppie sister. **** ******* is also wonderful as the grounded ****, the nerdy friend who finally finds out fulfillment when he meets ********, a single mother. As ********, ***** ******, makes a felicitous, albeit of a short, appearance in the film.<br /><br />The director is enormously gifted, who will no doubt go places because he shows he is well suited for the job.
