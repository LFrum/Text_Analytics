To answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the U.S. official mentioned in "*******", the name of the character is "Mr. ********." ***** ******** is reported as having been at that time Second Secretary at the U.S. Embassy in the Congo. Subsequently, among other assignments, he was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense, and is now the Chairman of the Carlyle Group. It's hardly surprising that ********'s biographical sketch on his www.carlylegroup.com web site fails to credit his service in the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored from the HBO version of "*******" it may have been to avoid the possibility of HBO's being sued in U.S. courts. ********'s name, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatre version of "*******" that I saw recently. In the event, I expect that he would deny any involvement in *******'s murder.<br /><br />Others have commented on the evenhandedness with which the film "*******" treats the parties concerned: *******-supporters, other Congolese, even Belgians. A somewhat more sinister view emerges, I think, from the BBC documentary entitled "Who Killed *******?", based on the book "The Murder of *******" by Belgian historian Ludo de *****. When examined closely, these films demonstrate that the fate of ******* and the history of the Congo is not just a matter of black and white. Only *******'s murderers believe that.
