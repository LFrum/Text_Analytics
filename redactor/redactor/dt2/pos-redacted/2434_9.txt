Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as *** *******. The music from award winning composer ****** ****** [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of ***** ****], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous Ambassador *****] are all right on target as famous tv director ****** Day [Kojak, ******* of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.
