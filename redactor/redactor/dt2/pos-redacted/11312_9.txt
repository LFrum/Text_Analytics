This movie was a riot, it pokes fun of "******* - Truth Or Dare" in all the right places. I love ******* & I love ***** *****. How could I ask for more..Julie's spoof of "Vogue", entitled "Vague" was hysterical.. "***** ******* thinks she's great, she's just cold boogers on a paper plate". "****** *******, Dawber, *** personality of Spam"!! I could've died! And just wait till you see what she can do with a watermelon!!
