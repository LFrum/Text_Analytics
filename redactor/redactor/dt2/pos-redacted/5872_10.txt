I first saw this film as a teenager (I'm now in my 40's), and have long considered it to be my favorite movie. The story is enormously moving, without being sentimental. The acting, especially by ***** and ***, is dead-on. And the fact that **** ******* is too old for his role doesn't take away from the believability of his romance with ******* ****** (whom I believe is the only major character in the film still living). This could have turned out to be another post-war melodrama, but the script and cast are simply too good for that to happen.
