I find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the story of the a-bomb and it's development for decades after the Manhattan Project was completed. My suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the movie and entertainment industries (in the 1950s through the 1970s) with "McCarthyism" and related national security phobias (including the Hollywood blacklist). There was one film in the 1950s (with ****** ******) about Col. **** ******* who flew the Enola Gay in the Hiroshima bombing, but otherwise nothing else. One could glance at a side issue tragedy (the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis soon after the delivery of the bombs to Tinian) in ****** ****'s description of the shark attacks on the survivors in JAWS. But the actual trials and tribulations of Groves, ***********, and their team was not considered film-able.<br /><br />And then in 1989 two films appeared. I have reviewed one already (DAY ONE) which I feel is the better of the two in discussing the lengthy technical and emotional and political problems in the Manhattan Project. The acting of Brian ******* as General Groves and ***** ********* as *********** was first rate and neatly balanced. Small side vignettes concerning the anti-bomb crusade of Szilard (******* ******) help fill out the story well.<br /><br />That's the problem here. **** ****** is a great actor (as is *** *******) but ****** approached Groves in a different way that while not dreadful is lesser than *******'s intelligent but soft spoken military brass. ****** seems too popped eyed about the possibility of the weapon as the biggest stick to confront the other boys in the after-school yard with. Yes it certainly was, but the real Groves would have been more like ******* keeping his mind not on that great toy of the future but on the business of creating that great toy. <br /><br />Dwight *******'s performance as Oppeheimer helps maintain the film's basically interesting and good production, aided by ****** ******* as his wife. But the most interesting aspect of this film is in the upgrading of the two tragedies of Daghlian and ******, in particular the latter, in the character of **** ******'s Merriman. Inevitably in all technological advances people are killed. It's just that these two tragedies (on top of the tens of thousands that were lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought home the dangers of the new unleashed power even in a so-called peaceful, controlled experiment. The two tragedies (particularly ***** ******'s slow, agonizing death by radiation poisoning) showed how much care was needed in using atomic power - and how the barest of chances could still cause disaster. The only really different thing I saw in Cusack's performance (and the script) and the actual incident with ****** was that ****** actually took some time after the accident to figure out where all his fellow research scientists were when they were hit by the radiation from the accident (he was able to show that only he got the full effect of the accidental blast, so that only relatively minor treatment would be needed by the others). Perhaps the full story of ******'s actions was too technical for the screen, but given the humongous pain he suffered in the end that he took time off to think of the others shows what a first rate person he really was.
