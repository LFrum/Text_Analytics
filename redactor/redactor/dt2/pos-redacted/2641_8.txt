While I hold its predecessor, "**** ***** At Ridgemont High," as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, "The Wild Life" is one of the better lesser known films from that time-and a worthy sequel, if you can call it that. I believe its tagline reads, "From the makers of FTARH, something even faster." This definitely holds true. Though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates, teen sex, and abortions, "The Wild Life" is, nonetheless, a great flick. It's pure chaotic fun, especially due to ***** ****'s over-the-top character, ****** *****. If ******** was high on coke instead of weed, he would be *****. **** Stoltz, in his first major role, is great as the straight-laced **** ******. The two characters work well off one another. Think a younger, hipper *** ******, complete with 80's gloss. Outside of them there are so many other great things about this film worth mentioning. *** Thompsom has never looked cuter, especially during the scenes of her working at the donut shop. ***** ****** is just delectable and fun to watch. **** Moranis plays a great nerd/perv who is dying to get in her pants. ****** *****'s wrestler buddies are hysterical, especially *****, the little Puerto Rican guy, who says some pretty memorable lines. One in particular that he yells out during a night out at a strip club had me on the floor the first time I saw it. That's saying something! Finally, the movie ends with one of the best 80's party scenes on film, ever. Look out for special appearances by *** **** of the Rolling Stones, *** **** (Sean and ***** ****'s dad), and a random ******* ******* look-alike at the party. Throw in a score by none other than the man himself, ***** *** *****, and you can't go wrong. For *** ***** fans, keep your ears open for riffs that would be found on such albums as 5150, OU812, and For ******** ****** Knowledge.<br /><br />If anything disrupts the flow of the movie it is a small subplot involving ***** ***** as a burned out Vietnam vet. It just seems out of place and unnecessary. Other than that, it's near perfect. If your a fan of mindless but fun 80's movies and have not yet seen this one, you're in for something special. RENT IT NOW!!! <br /><br />p.s.-The credits say ******* ***** has a cameo as one of the cops in the film. Does he have his back turned during his scene because I have yet to find him. Someone please help me.
