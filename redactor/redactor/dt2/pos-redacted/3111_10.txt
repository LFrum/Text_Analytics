I loved this film because of the dialog and superb acting by ******* and **********. However, I never knew until now, watching a ***** David marathon on TNT that this film is a remake of a 1943 ***** ***** classic called *** Acquaintance. ***** co-stars with ****** ******* who she was in a terrible feud with during the making of the movie because ***** had had an affair with ******'s husband who directed her in a film before they made *** Acquaintance.<br /><br />Anyway, both are worth every minute spent watching. I highly recommend this film if you like a lot of dialog and drama. It's a study in the psychology of women and their relationships with each other, in my opinion.
