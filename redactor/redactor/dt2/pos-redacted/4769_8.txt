just can't watch this bit too many times, it's full of true enthusiasm and cleverness ****** ***** had in his first 30 years. ********' ****** is an smart ass little whiner when compared this. ********* ****** always makes me smile, at least the ending where ****** laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. Animation is very nice and although steamboat ****** has no dialog, the music is enough for it.<br /><br />IMHO if this bit doesn't deserve 10/10 then any cartoon doesn't not only because it's a true classic, but also because it's so full of joy and it's always fun to watch.
