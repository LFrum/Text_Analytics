The majesty of ***** *******'s second feature is that, like the work of a poet, he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen. Beyond the scope of most other indie films out there, CHOP SHOP is wise, exuding the very best of the great cinema of the ages; we can look back at the works of ******* and ******** and compare *******'s work to theirs, and yet CHOP SHOP is fresh and urgent to modern society. We can see the workings of a master here  a certain sense of beauty, style, and content all merge together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on the side of NYC we so often see, we live and breathe with our young hero, *********, in the destitute ******* *****  a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture  and yet it's a very, very real place. Trying to stay afloat, ********* has to support himself and his older sister. Watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that ******* leads us toward  all with profound and concise realism.
