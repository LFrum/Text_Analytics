******* and Z-Boys<br /><br />Summary: ******* and Z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers that changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (*******), California as we know it today. With their low pivotal style, they embarked on a ***** ********* influenced journey that would lead to countless successes and a couple failures. After the ******* articles were featured in a reinstated Skateboarder Magazine, the sport was revamped and the members of the Zephyr skateboard team forgot about **** **, and looked to be on summer vacation for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that could afford to pay them like movie stars. The original ****** ********** **** put together by **** ** (Zephyr Surfshop Owner) and ***** ****** (Photographer) included *** *****, **** ****, ***** *******, *** ******, ***** ******, ***** ****, **** *************, *** ****, ***** *** (the only female), ****** *****, ******* **** **, ***** *****, and ***** *** *****. All of the original members except *** ***** and ***** ****** are still well and surfing/skating. *** *****, at the time of the documentary, was serving time on drug related charges. ***** ******, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico.<br /><br />Themes: The themes of this documentary are kind of read-between-the-lines, but if there were a clear-cut theme it would be that even kids can spark revolutions. Other themes would include extensive partying in one's past may lead to an unfulfilling future, and by planning and being careful with one's assets a very rewarding future could be at hand.<br /><br />Other Works: ***** ******* (Writer and Director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has either written, produced, or directed. Most with a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding ******, *** TV, The Bones Brigrades, and Lords of *******. He has also done films with a theme of growing up in America as a teenager, films such as: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, ***** and ******: Made in America, and The 70s: The Decade that Changed Television.<br /><br />Subjects: The subjects of ******* and Z-boys are the original members of the ****** ********** **** excluding ***** ******. ******* included **** ** and ***** ****** in the interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up during the 70s reading the ******* Articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. Skaters from the ******* area, but not on the team were interviewed.<br /><br />Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion. There were scenes of the subjects talking so that the audience could see who was speaking and get a sense of the character, but would immediately cutaway to archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when *** *****' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by **** ***** was played, which evokes many emotions. Sean **** was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented chronologically from the time the Zephyr surf team was put together, to creating the skateboard team, to all of the Z-boys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /><br />Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way. The film of the subjects speaking were all in black and white and all of the archival footage of the Z-Boys surfing or skating were in color. Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film. The interviewees were mostly shot in the same area it appears, but all were outside. All of the footage was very well-controlled even the archival footage which I found very surprising. <br /><br />Music: "Seasons of Wither"-Performed by ********* "Toys in the Attic"-Performed by ********* "Generation Landslide"- ***** ****** "One Way Out"- Performed by The Allman Brothers "Lollipops and *****" and "Whipped *****"-performed by **** ****** "Into the Void" and "Paranoid"- performed by ***** ******* "Godzilla"- **** ****** **** "******* ****" and "***** *****"- ***** ***** "Fastcars"- The Buzzcocks "*** *******"- Devo "I'll Give you Money"- ***** ******** "Funk 49"- ***** **** "*** *****" and "**** ****" and "*******" and "Bold as ****"- **** ******* "******** *******"- *** and Dean "Achilles Last Stand" and "Hot on for Nowhere"- *** ******** "Six Underground"- The Sneaker Pimps "Surfrider"- The Lively Ones "*** ******* *****" and "***** **** ********" and "**** **** ***** Poontang- Ted Nugent "Us and Them"- **** ***** "*** ****"- The Pretenders "****** ***"- *** ******* "I Wanna be Your Dog" and "Gimme ******"- The Stooges "Children of the Revolution"- T-Rex "*** **********"- **** ***** "***** *******"- The Tramps "Hannah"- *** ****** "***** ******** ***"- *** ***** "Old Man"- **** ***** "La Grange"- ZZ Top<br /><br />The music in the film make the movie. Every one of these songs contributes to what the subjects are saying and evoke emotions that would not have been called to mind otherwise.
