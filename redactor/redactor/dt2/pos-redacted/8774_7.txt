Overall, this is entertaining and odd film. Don't try to make sense of it. There are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with, but ****** ******** and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this "Fugitive"-like story.<br /><br />Unlike the popular TV show and then 1993 movie, this fugitive isn't looking for a one-armed man, but a two-armed Nazi saboteur by the the name of "***** ***." Cummings ("***** ****") gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in Los Angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it (Fry) to clear his name.<br /><br />The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then ********* **** ("*** ******") enters the story, and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog. ******** ****** ********* often did that with his female characters, to the point I wonder if he had a clue how woman talked. ****'s character here was a little lame.<br /><br />Actually, the villains played by **** ****** ("******* *****") and ****** ***** ("***** ***") were the best, in my opinion......just fascinating. ******'s acting and dialog was especially good.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film but saw *********'s well-known "North By Northwest," you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it. Instead of a climactic scene at Mount Rushmore, here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the State Of Liberty. As usual, ********* camera angles are great and fun to view.
