This is a very modest, very lovely movie with a great score by ***** ********** and ***** ******* with a standout number, We're The Couple In The Castle, that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to Penthouse Serenade just as the opening premise (Hoppity's coming) may well have inspired **** ***** and *** *******'s opening (*****'s Coming) in Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name ****** appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect. It's wonderfully inventive, never more so than when objects barely noticed in the 'real' world assume a much greater significance - both pro and con - in the insect world. Actually it IS a classic, albeit a minor one.
