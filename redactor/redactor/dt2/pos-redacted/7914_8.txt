When ******** ****** is attacked after witnessing her cousin's murder,********* ******** searches the city for her killer.Identifying the murderer after an intensive manhunt,******** is sent to live with relatives in the country.For Carrella the case is closed...or is it?"***** *********" is an overlooked masterpiece.Donald Sutherland plays a cop and it's nice to see ****** ********* in a small role as a child molester.The conclusion is pretty disturbing.Still "***** *********" is more of a mystery than a horror film,so fans of gore will be disappointed.A must-see for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies.9 out of 10.
