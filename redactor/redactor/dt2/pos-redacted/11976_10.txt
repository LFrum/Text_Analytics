If you want to have a great time then this is THE movie to watch.<br /><br />Take the premise - There is this college which admits people with minimum qualifications of BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, B.E., M.Tech and BCA. So you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are 40+ Also the school admits students of a 'heavier' dispensation and has a course of P.Hd in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is ******* *******. Only she was a snake in the past life. Still not convinced? OK read on.<br /><br />Here's a scene. ****** Kumar, a college student, is chased by ***** and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him! Then throws grenades. Then one of the grenades hits ******. But doesn't die and continues to fight, *****, the snake, plunges a half foot dagger into ****** and stomps on it but ****** is still there. Then ****** gets on a jet ski and follows *****. They fight and ***** chokes ****** underwater and finally ****** is dead. So we think, as soon as ***** is out of the picture ****** swims away to *** ******, Principal of this college + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology ka professor + mumbling priest.<br /><br />But no one, I repeat no one takes the cake but a certain *** *****. You gotto watch to learn more. :-)
