One of the better musical bios. ****** ****** is great as the singer/composer ******** ******. The supporting cast is very good, especially ****** **** as the glamorous ******* *******. The turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting. The technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie just makes you feel good. ****** was always underrated as an actor and a singer.
