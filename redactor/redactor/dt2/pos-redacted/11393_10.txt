Everything that you need to know about the pornography of the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in **** ****** ********'s BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although the film is completely fictional, it is actually supposedly based on the story of porno kingpin **** Holmes.<br /><br />In Southern California in 1977, ***** ***** (**** ********) is working as a busboy in a nightclub. One of the regular customers is pornographer **** ****** (**** ********) and two of his starlets, ***** ***** (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (******* ******). **** and ***** meet and **** realizes that ***** is well...a little...gifted.<br /><br />So ***** stars in ****'s films under the pseudonym of "**** *******." He becomes a "big" porno star (no pun intended) and seems to be on top of everything. Then comes the 80s when video replaces film and ****'s porno empire begins to collapse, along with **** ******* and everybody else working in the field.<br /><br />BOOGIE NIGHTS is a really well-filmed drama. There is a little bit of violence, but P.T. ******** makes it more stylized. And it kind of is a scathing approach to the degradations of pornography, especially when VHS became the standard medium for making pornos.<br /><br />A lot of bizarre and unique characters are introduced. ******* H. Macy has an interesting role as someone working on the films, whose wife keeps having sex with everybody. I especially liked *** *******'s role as Buck the stereo salesman. The best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely **** ********. A 90s classic!
