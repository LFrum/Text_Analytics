****** *****'s "***** ***: The Bed That ****" is, at root, a dark fairy tale told via a horror-movie framework. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it's downright criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without *****'s knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be fed to the bed, ASAP). If you're looking for overt gore or rabid action, "***** ***: The Bed That ****" isn't the flick for you. "***** ***" is a gentler, weirder drive-in picture; it plays like an utterly strange dream, half-remembered. I'd recommend reading ******* *******'s summation of "***** ***" in Thrower's FAB Press book, "********* ***" (he describes the movie's vibe perfectly). Whether intentional or not, I've noticed shades of "***** ***" in everything from the "Phantasm" films to ******* *****'s "Cemetery Man" to the magic-realism/slipstream fiction of authors such as ***** ****. ***** is an original and in a fair world I'm sure he would've followed "***** ***" with a number of fantastically bizarre films.
