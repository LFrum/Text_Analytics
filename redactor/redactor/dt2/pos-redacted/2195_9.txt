The genius that is ******* ******** was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 "Musical Thriller" SWEENEY TODD, a Gothic, gory, grisly, yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to London to exact revenge on the evil Judge who not only had him permanently exiled from London, but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to "shield her from all the evils of the world." The barber finds love,sympathy, and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where **** is concerned. This musical rocked ******** and won nine Tony Awards, including **** ******* and **** ******* in a Musical (****** ********). The production was filmed in its entirety in 1982 with ****** ******** recreating her ******** role as Mrs. ******, the daffy pie shop owner who finds a practical use for the heads that **** makes mincemeat out of. ****** *****, who replaced *** ****** on ********, is electrifying in the title role, so much so that you have to wonder why he wasn't originally cast in the role. Lansbury and Hearn are riveting from start to finish and commit 100% to their ghoulish characters aided, by a first rate ********* score, probably the closest thing ******** has written to an opera. Lansbury shines on "The Worst Pies in London" and "By the Sea". ****** ***** stops the show with "Epiphany" and is also compelling during "Pretty Women", a duet he sings with Judge ******, the man he has sworn revenge on. **** ********* is vocally impressive as ******, the young sailer who rescues **** and falls for his daughter *******. ***** Joselyn is a little over the top as ******* and really pushes vocally to the point that during "***** ***** and ****** ****" she actually drives her voice off-pitch during a couple of moments. The rest of the cast is first rate, especially ****** ******* as Judge ****** who gets to perform "*******" in this production, which was cut from the original production and *** ******** as ****, whose gorgeous tenor fills the auditorium on "Not While I'm Around." But it is breathtaking musical score by ******* ******** and the mesmerizing performance by Lansbury an especially ****** ***** that makes this night of Gothic musical theater an experience that stays with you long after curtain call. Not for all tastes, but if you're game and have strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy for all music theater lovers and a must for fans of ******* ******** and ****** ********.
