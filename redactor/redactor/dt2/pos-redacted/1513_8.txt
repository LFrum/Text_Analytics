"Un Gatto nel Cervello"/"Cat in the Brain" is one of the goriest horror movies ever made.There is a lot of blood and gore,including chainsaw butchery,bloody stabbings and numerous decapitations.The film is also interesting as "self parody" of *****,but the gore and violence is the key element in it.Some of the gore FX were taken from own *****'s movies "****** ***** ***** lo Specchio" and "I ******** di ******"(both 1988),plus gore FX taken from *****-supervised "The Snake House" aka "****** ******" by ******* *********,"********" by ****** *******,"*** ***** ***** ***** *** *****" by ***** *******,"*** ** ******* i *******" by ******** ********* and "Luna di ******" aka "Fuga dalla Morte" by **** *******(all 1989).The scene where ***** ****** beats the woman's face to pulp is from "****** ***** ***** lo Specchio",a film ***** had made for Italian TV in 1988.The chainsawing of the female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same film,as is the head in the microwave and the guy that gets driven over and over again.Highly recommended,especially if you like extreme cinema!
