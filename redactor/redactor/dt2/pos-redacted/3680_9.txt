This movie is the most moving and funny movie I've seen in a very long time. As a housewife ( "homemaker") and a fan ( ******) I found it to be sympathetic . Anyone who misinterprets ****'s angry outburst has it wrong. ***** Bates is not really an actress I know but she is perfect , the whole cast is perfect for their roles. ***** ******* had me in stitches .I am watching it after reading ******'s auto-biography so the inclusion of her was even more fun. It is at times terribly moving .I am not really a fan of the type of music in the film but you get drawn in to the romance and find you are singing the songs for days .This movie deserves to be more widely available .Our favourite scene involves **** and a gun and his trousers , watch it and see !
