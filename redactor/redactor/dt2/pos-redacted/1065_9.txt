It finally hit me watching my VHS of ********* in Connecticut what other film this one reminded me of. If it weren't for the fact that the other was done 20 years later, I'd say it was a remake.<br /><br />Just as **** ****** was a phony fishing expert for Abercrombie&***** who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament, ******* ******** plays an forties version of ****** ******* *<br /><br />********'s a cooking columnist who's built up this whole image of living on a small Connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies. Trouble is she's unmarried, childless, writes her column from her apartment in New York and doesn't know how to boil water. But her writing is a hit with the public.<br /><br />Trouble comes when she's hijacked into cooking a home ********* dinner for a war hero sailor played by ****** ****** who gets to sing a couple of songs as well. Got to keep up the image at any cost. And her publisher ****** *********** likes the idea so well that he invites himself to the dinner.<br /><br />So with borrowed farm, baby, and ******** ******** who'd like to make it real with ******** she tries to brazen it through. <br /><br />********* in Connecticut's now a Yuletide classic and deservedly so. The leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players. S.Z. Sakall as the Hungarian restaurant owner/friend of ******** from whom she gets her cooking information and *** O'Connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them. ******** ******** and ******** have no chemistry at all, obvious to all but ****** and he's funny in his stuffed shirt way.<br /><br />Most people remember this film as one of ****** ***********'s few ventures into comedy. If he's not an outright villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is few other things on screen. ********* in Connecticut gave him a rare opportunity to burlesque his own image and he made the most of it.<br /><br />In a biography of ******* ********, she mentions she enjoyed making ********* in Connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like ****** ********* she'd been doing recently. One of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes, director ***** ******* and Greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with ******* ***** **** numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly.<br /><br />Now if only someone had been filming those numbers.
