The brainchild of comic strip pioneer **** *******, "***** ******" was the grand daddy of all sci-fi epics. This serial is the first time ***** was brought to celluloid life. Despite it's low budget, this is a great space opera.<br /><br />The story begins with ***** doomed to apparent destruction, when the Planet ***** comes hurtling through space on a collision course. Maverick scientist Dr. ****** is headed off for the approaching planet in a self-made rocket ship, convinced he can do something to stop the runaway celestial body. He gets some last minute recruits in the form of resourceful athlete ***** ****** and beautiful **** *****. Once they reach *****, their problems really begin. They run afoul of dastardly Emperor Ming the Merciless, conqueror of his world, who has some ambitious plans for *****.<br /><br />The rest of the serial revolves around *****'s desperate attempts to save the earth; the assorted alien cultures he encounters; the allies he makes; space ships he flies; the battles he fights, and the monsters he slays.<br /><br />Brilliantly conceived by *******, "***** ******" features classic archetypes from legendary myths and fables of antiquity. Echos of famous tales, like the sagas of Troy and ******* and Sherwood Forrest are seen here. You have the dashing, handsome hero, on a quest to save the kingdom (*****); The evil king (Ming); The old wise man (******); The lovely damsel in distress (Dale); the seductive siren (Aura); loyal allies (Thun, *****, Vultan); Plus monsters, dragons and assorted beasties.<br /><br />***** is a modern ***** ****, ***** or Beowulf. Ming is Prince **** or Aggamemnon. Dale is ***** of Troy or Gwenevere or **** ******. ****** is ****** or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun/*****/Vultan are the Merry Men or the Knights of the Round Table.<br /><br />You get the idea.<br /><br />You can't help but notice how many ideas from "***** ******" would later reappear in STAR WARS. The cloud City; The ice World; The forest moon; The scrolling opening text (From the second serial); There are others, but you get the gist. The whole sci-fi genre owes a great debt to this timeless classic.<br /><br />Buster Crabb is the perfect action hero, and I personally think he's better at this sort of role than any of the current crop of action stars. He also played **** ****** and Tarzan.<br /><br />******* ********* is the embodiment of diabolical nastiness as Ming. Sure, he seems a bit melodramatic today, but that was what audiences expected from their bad guys in the 30's. <br /><br />**** ****** is our hero's love interest **** *****, and I had such a crush on her when I first saw this as a boy. I can readily understand why ***** always rushed to her rescue. She's the quintessential good girl, to counterpoint the seductive manipulations of Aura, the quintessential bad girl.<br /><br />The supporting cast seemed perfectly chosen to emulated their comic strip counterparts, and despite the now-silly looking FXs, there was a lot of thrilling action in this groundbreaking serial.<br /><br />An all around fun romp and the beginning of the sci-fi genre in cinema.
