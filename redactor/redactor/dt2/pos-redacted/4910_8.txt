Story about a widowed father (****** *****) bringing up his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by big hunky Ernest (**** *****). Thea (Lola Lane) is romanced by an old but wealthy man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. **** dead handsome ***** ***** (******* ****), a business associate of their father, comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Then tough cynical Mickey (**** ********) enters the picture...<br /><br />Very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five Academy Awards. It's beautifully directed by ******* ******, has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a VERY attractive cast (especially Lynn). Also this was **** ********'s first film and made him a star. This was so popular there were three or four sequels (which I never saw). This is an engrossing, entertaining, big budget soap opera--well worth seeing.
