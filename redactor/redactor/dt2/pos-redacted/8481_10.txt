***** **** absolutely IS *** *******. His performance is simply genius. He owns the film, just as ****** owned "**** *****'s Daughter" and ***** owned "***** ***** of Fire." In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of *** ******* is being acted, and not played by the man himself. *** ******* is legendary. He is well-established as a musician and the music is deep, complex, and innovative ~ even more innovative than I realized before watching this movie. The film should make new fans of a young audience who might come into it knowing little about his music. *** *******' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician. I confess that I knew very little about the man's life until I saw this film. I came out of it being impressed with *** *******' courage, strength, and innovation as man and musician.
