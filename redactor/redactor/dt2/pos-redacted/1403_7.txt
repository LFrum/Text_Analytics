I just watched this, an early ****** ***** short film that featured his "glasses" character on **** *****'s DVD of "The ****** ***** Collection". He's actually a con man with **** ******* as his partner who gets discovered by **** ******* who herself performs fake s√©ances. What she discovers is that ***** and ******* bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are "lost". I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when ****** and Snub enter the place Bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's outfits. Not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny. So on that note, I recommend Are Crooks Dishonest?
