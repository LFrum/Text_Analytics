This film is exceptional in that ******* & ******* present outstanding performances. The acting in this film is the greatest strength of the production, but the script, direction, and editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exsists between the two stars. If you like *******, and you like *******, you'll love this film..... (It's a classic that compares with **********.)<br /><br />
