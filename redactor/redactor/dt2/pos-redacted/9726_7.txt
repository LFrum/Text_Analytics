Had no idea what I was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940. However, I always enjoy viewing ******* Day, (***** ********) who plays the role as a younger sister to **** ****, (***** ********) and also their mother, ****** *****, (Mrs. Julia Lattimer). Thought I was going to be bored with the story of two sister's and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet up with ****** ********, (****** *****) who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has plenty of gals and is a heavy drinker who parties all the time. One night, ***** ******** goes on a date with ****** and he proceeds to get bombed out of his mind and simply cannot drive his car. It is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film which will definitely hold your attention right to the very end of the film.
