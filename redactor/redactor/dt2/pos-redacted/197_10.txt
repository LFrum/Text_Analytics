This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II ******** (******* *********) is in love with ***** (******* *******) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. ***** leaves for the front before ******** can tell him she loves him. ***** is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to ******** or his family. ****, *****' cousin, rapes ******** who feels obligated to marry him. Degraded and demeaned by the cowardly ****, ******** clings to the hope that someday ***** will return. Superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director *********. (For anyone interested in film technique another movie by *********, I AM CUBA, has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, rises two stories to a cigar factory, tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long, long avenue - all without a cut.) Superb acting, particularly by ********* and ****** ********* (as *****' uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement. A devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by *********. (This movie is frequently linked with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)
