"Strike Force" or "The Librarians" is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously. ******* Forsythe stars as *****, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets up with Sandi (***** *******) who is also looking for someone-her sister. But there are evil bad guys afoot. The most evil of them all is ****** ********* (****** ******). ****** likes to kill people. So now, ***** and Sandi have to team up to bring down the villains. The whole cast is great, with ****** stealing the movie. There are also cameos by ** ****** and **** ********. If you are looking for a good action film, watch this and have a good time.
