This is actually a brilliant movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially the performance of **** ********* as *****, is magnificent. It's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own, but it unfolds to a strange and absurd story, with a lot of people accidentally getting killed and served up as chicken steaks. If only more people understood danish... This could be a great candidate for an English version. It is also worth mentioning *** ********, who always delivers that extra twist to the plot, with his slightly mad character ******. I can only recommend this movie to the danish audience. Also take a look at Adams Ã†bler (2005), a movie by ****** ****** ******, also with **** ********* accompanied by a well playing ****** *******.
