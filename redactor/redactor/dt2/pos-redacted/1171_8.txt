"Out to Sea" is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of **** ****** and ****** *******. This film is not quite as funny as their "****** *** ***" comedies (which it strongly resembles), but there are many laughs throughout. ****** and ******* play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. Once they get on the boat, the thing ****** doesn't know is that ******* has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates ****** who's in no mood to dance. What's worse, ******* doesn't even know how to dance. Nevertheless, they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members: there's the cruise director *** ******, played to the hilt by "**** ****: The Next Generation" veteran Brent ******, who acts like an evil dictator. There's two fellow dance hosts, played by "****** ******" star *** ****** and veteran movie musical star ****** O'Connor. There's the ship's owner Mrs. Carruthers, played by "****** ****" *** **********. As for the passengers: there's Vivian, a widow played by ****** ** *****, who falls in love with ******. There's ***, played by one of my all-time favorite actresses, **** ******, who falls in love with *******. There's *****, ***'s mother, played by veteran stage actress ****** *******. And they meet others as well. All these actors are a pleasure to watch as ****** and ******* play off of them. It's great to see ****** here, see's beautiful as ever; ******* is a hoot; ****** is a funny comic villain who's plays it deadly straight; ** ***** is wonderful; ******, O'Connor, and McClanahan have a good moment or two; and finally, the two main stars, ****** and *******, are fine as usual. A nice little gem of a comedy.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
