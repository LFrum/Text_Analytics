"The Moon Is ****" director **** ********* tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release "The Man with the Golden Arm." Whereas he had incensed the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words "virgin" and "mistress" in his mild 1953 comedy "The Moon Is ****," ********* went far beyond what any movie had attempted with "The Man with the Golden Arm" since **** ****** made his law and order epic "To the Ends of the Earth"(1946) about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics. Based on ****** ******'s novel that won the 1950 National Book Award, this gritty, uncompromising, 119-minute, black & white melodrama deals with heroin addiction. Initially, when *********'s film came out, the Motion Picture Association of America would not issue its seal of approval because the filmmakers depicted addiction to narcotics. This groundbreaking film qualified as the first major motion picture to handle narcotics from the dope fiend's perspective and actually showed the paraphernalia that junkies wielded to shoot up heroin. The Production Code stipulated that filmmakers must refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics. Nevertheless, United Artists released this unique ***** ******* picture and it grossed over $4-million dollars. <br /><br />The critical and commercial success of "The Man with the Golden Arm" eviscerated the Production Code. As a result, the MPAA amended the Code so that filmmakers could delve into other taboo subjects, such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion and prostitution. The film received three ******* ***** nominations. Oscar nominations went to ******* for **** ******, ****** ** ****** and ******* ******* for **** *** Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and ***** ********* for **** *****, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Indeed, ***** ********* made a name for himself with his jazzy score. The producers had thought about casting ****** ****** in the title role, but ******* beat ****** to the punch. ******* ******, *** *****, Arnold Stang, ****** *******, and ****** ******* co-starred with *** **** ****. McGavin was particularly memorable as a sleazy heroin dealer, while ******* ****** played the protagonist's wife with a dark, deep secret of her own that comes as quite a shock. <br /><br />"The Man with the Golden Arm" refers to protagonist ******* *******'s ability to manipulate a deck of cards. ******* deals cards for **** ********* (****** ******* of "Stalag 17") but he has been out of Chicago for the last six months in a federal narcotics hospital recovering from heroin addiction. Not only has ******* licked the habit, but he also has learned how to play the drums and plans to embark of a music career. Optimistic as ***** is about his future, he finds himself facing his past all over again when he returns to his old stomping grounds. ********* wants him to deal for him again, and ***** ***** ********** (****** ******* of "Counter-Attack") tries to induce him to resume his heroin usage. Meanwhile, ******* comes home to his invalid, wheel-chair bound wife, **** (******* ****** of "Escape from Fort Bravo"), who manipulates him with guilt. ******* was drunk when he had a car accident and **** wound up in a wheel chair. ******* shows up with high hopes and a drum set, but **** sees no future for him as a musician and urges to go back to work for *********. ******* plans to visit a music promoting and one of his own friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang of "My Sister ******"), shoplifts a business suit from a department store for *******. After ******* refuses to work for ********* because he is going to see musical agent ***** **** (**** ****** of "The Wild One"), ********* turns both ***** and Sparrow into the police. Meanwhile, ********* gets *****'s Department Store to drop the shoplifting charges. The suit was worth $37.00. ******* agrees to resume dealing for ********* and the hustler bails him out. Not long afterward, despite his resolution to shun heroin use, ******* breaks down and pays ***** the $2.00 for a fix. <br /><br />Eventually, ******* meets ***** **** and **** warns him that he is catches ******* shooting up that he will have nothing to do with him. What poor ******* doesn't know is that **** has recovered her ability to walk, but she uses his guilt about the accident to hold on to him. **** is also jealous of her downstairs neighbor, ***** ******* (*** ***** of "Picnic"), *******'s former sweetheart who hustles drinks at a nearby strip bar called the Safari Club. When **** complains about headaches that ******* gives her practicing on his drum set, ******* moves them downstairs into *****'s apartment. ********* and ***** are planning a big poker game with *** ******** (****** ** ***** of "Guys and *****") and ******** (****** ******* of "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"), two big-time gamblers who have heard about ***** and his legendary 'golden arm.' ********* and ***** persuade a reluctant ******* to deal for $250. After an early winning streak, ******* starts losing and he cannot reverse his bad luck. In fact, ******* spends about two days dealing. Exhausted, his nerves shot and desperate for a fix, he falls apart on the second day and ******** and ******** catch him cheating. ***** refuses to give ******* a fix, so ******* knocks him out and ransacks his apartment for the heroin.<br /><br />********* pulls no punches in "The Man with the Golden Arm," and the film is pretty disillusioning. None of the characters here are remotely sympathetic. Essentially, they are either hustlers or hustled. ******* gives another dynamite performance as does McGavin and Parker. To be sure, "The Man with the Golden Arm" has lost much of its impact in the intervening 50 or more years, but it still ranks as a landmark film.
