Wow, "The Curse of ******* *****" what a great film. Suspenseful, entertaining, creative and a clever plot which I love. Many hate the 'Thorn' concept, I love it. I think that it gives the Halloween series some plot. ******** Hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance, especially for her first film and **** **** and ****** ********* are great also. My only complaint is that why wasn't ******** ****** in this film as *****? She wanted to return, but the producers said no. I thought J.C ****** was great, but I love ******** ******. Still, I love Halloween: The Curse of ******* *****. I think The Shape's mask looks the best in this film and ****** ** ****** is the best ******* ***** ever. Incredibly creepy and suspenseful, Halloween 6 rules! <br /><br />I adore this very violent, but immensely enjoyable film. The Halloween horror series - by far the best in the Genre.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
