*** ******'s The Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids. I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great story, and great wit that it is irresistable. The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by ******) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way, he meets ****** ****, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), **** *****, ****, and DR. Teeth and the electric mayhem.<br /><br />This film has so many good things I can't even say them. But it is memorable and every time I think of a puppet or muppet, I will think of this film. Look for cameos from *** ******, *** ********, **** ********, ******** ****, *** ****, ******* *****, ***** martin, ***** ****** (and ******* *********), ****** *****, ***** **** and the great ***** ******. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best films of the 70's. A++
