For many years I thought I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST, and I am so glad to learn that I am not the only person who discovered this sleeper somewhere in their movie-going travails. Loosely based on the Shakesperean play, TEMPEST follows an architect (the late **** ***********, in one of his best performances), bored with his work and his crumbling marriage (to real life spouse **** *******), who decides to chuck it all, say the hell with the rat race and go live on an island with his daughter (***** ********, in her film debut), and new girlfriend Aretha (a luminous ***** ********). Even though **** ******** is credited as director, *********** hand is all over this film...the long scenes filmed without cutting, the improvisatory feel to the dialogue..., the self-indulgent storytelling style, this is definitely his show from beginning to end, and if you're not a fan of his work, the film will seem laboriously long and dull but if you are a fan, there are rewards to be had. *********** is surrounded by a first rate cast...his scenes with ******** crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with ******** is a stark contrast to his scenes with ********. Ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a scene-stealing performance by the late **** ***** as *********, ***********' manservant on the island. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by **** ******** singing "New York, New York". This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense. Yes, it's a little long and disjointed and it works a little too hard at being different (there's even a curtain call at the end of the film), but it never fails to hold the attention of those who like something a little different in their filmgoing.
