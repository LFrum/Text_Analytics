The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family: the twenty years old ***** Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is retarded due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother ****** ******** (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. The seventeen years old **** ******** (****** *******) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for *****. Their father ***** ******** (**** ******), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. **** mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected, and teaches the poetries of her own to *****. When ****** hears ***** repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to the English teacher ******* ****** (*********** *****), who believes that ***** has had a moment of geniuses. When ****'s only friend ***** (**** *****) reads the notes, he immediately discloses the truth about the authority of the poetries. But when ****** becomes aware, she finds the reality of ****, triggering a series of revelations.<br /><br />"Admissions" is a very powerful drama about needy of love and guilty complex. The performances are stunning, and this is the first work of ****** *******, from "Six Feet Under", that I see and she is amazing. This independent movie is an excellent choice for the viewers that are looking for a refreshing story based on the acting of the cast. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
