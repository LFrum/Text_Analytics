I remember this movie getting a lot of flak from reviewers when it was new. ********* and **** themselves had objections. ********* called it (paraphrasing) the biggest waste of film he'd ever seen, and **** objected to the simpleton portrayal of himself. But ********* had **** ******* ******* as a guest on his show so it seems he didn't take anything too personally. A DVD re-release, with opinions and such from those involved, could be interesting, though I suspect the days when late night talkshow wars captivated the nation are gone and not returning soon.<br /><br />I preferred the ********* impersonation to the ****, but could never buy in to either. They never rose above caricature, and I never simply accepted them as actors. For comparison: **** ******* as ********* in Oliver Stone's "Nixon" comes to mind as an impersonation which may have seemed laughable in the first few moments but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement wore off.<br /><br />The highlight of the show for me was ***** ******** as ******* *****. ********' speech to ********* was not as great as but reminiscent of **** *******'s entrance (and quick exit) as ***** in ********* **** Ross.<br /><br />They could have done more with ******'s role in all this. I know he was mostly uninvolved in the events portrayed in this movie, and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation such that ****** ****** needs no introduction. But more context about why **** and *** and all comedians revere ****** would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a gossip film.<br /><br />Guess I should read the book...<br /><br />**** ****** imitating ****** ******, unfortunately, came across as nothing more than **** ****** imitating ****** ******.<br /><br />I tell you what, after watching this movie, then watching either the ********* or **** show, all I want to do is crack open my ****** ****** DVDs and see the real thing.
