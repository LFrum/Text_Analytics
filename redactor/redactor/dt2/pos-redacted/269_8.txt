"Prime Suspect 4" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, ********* ************** **** ********; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5, & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer ***** ** ****** from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit ******** against the forces of evil while coping with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal. PS4 conjures two stories while PS5 & PS6 are single episodes each which find ******** seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. In other words, to prevail, ******** must overcome both evil and good forces, something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet grayer and the ******** wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers. Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series. (B+)
