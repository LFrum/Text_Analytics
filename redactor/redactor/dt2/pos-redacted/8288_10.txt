I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw it theatrically. ***** ******* did a good composition of the soundtrack. ***** Seville is the Chipmunks' father and recording manager. The Chipmunks consist of *****, who is best known for playing the harmonica, *****, who is a bright and studious chipmunk & Theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. There is a lady known as **** ******, who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as Brittany, ******** & *******, who all have the same character as the Chipmunks. My favourite songs from this soundtrack include "******* *****", The Girls of Rock & ****", & the touching "My Mother". ***** really wanted to see Europe when **** had to go there for business. The Chipmunks meet the Chipettes playing the Around the World in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing.
