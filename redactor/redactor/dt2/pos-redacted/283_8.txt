In the '60's/'70's, ***** ***** was renowned for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!', 'Hark At Barker' and the 'Doctor' series. It was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role, in London Weekend Television's 'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar ******', written by ******* ***** & ******* McKenna.<br /><br />Edgar ****** is a secret agent of the 'S.I.S' ('Secret Intelligence Service'). He genuinely tries to do his job well but always seems to mess things up. Astonishingly enough, though, he always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases, much to the amazement of his colleagues- 'Buxton' (******* ********), 'Spencer' (**** ****) and 'Cathy' (the lovely ********* ********), all of which answer to 'The Commander' (Noel Coleman).<br /><br />****** is married to 'Jennifer' (******* ******), a woman who, much like ******* *******'s 'Betty' from 'Some ******'s Do 'Ave 'Em!', has the patience of a saint and stands by her hare-brained (but well-meaning) husband, no matter what.<br /><br />Like 'Some ******'s Do 'Ave 'Em' and 'The ***** ***', 'T.T.S.L.O.E.B' was laced completely with slapstick. Each episode saw ***** perform stunts such as plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his flat. It was 'custard pie in the face' stuff really.<br /><br />'Edgar ******' was not a big hit, due to poor scheduling from I.T.V. A shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show, well served by its star and the fine support cast. The leading man, though, did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show. ***** ***** vetoed repeat screenings of the show because he felt his acting in it was non-refined. Granted, the ***** ***** who played 'Del Boy', 'Inspector *****' and 'Pop ******' is way different to the one that played ****** but by no means was his acting unrefined. Most actors would have turned ****** into a ridiculous caricature but *****'s performance made ****** a credible, realistic figure. *** perhaps, but not unimaginable.<br /><br />*****'s next vehicle was 'Lucky ******', in which he played mummy's boy 'Shorty Mempstead'. It too failed to make the ratings. His lucky break came in the shape of A.T.V's 'A Sharp Intake Of ******', in which he played walking disaster area 'Peter ******' for four series between 1977-1981. So, while not outstanding as such, '******' is an easy and worthwhile watch. Nice 'James ****' style theme tune, too!
