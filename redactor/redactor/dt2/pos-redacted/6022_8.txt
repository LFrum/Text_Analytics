If you want to see what could be classed as the 'stage' version of GYPSY this is the film for you.<br /><br />If you enjoy(ed) listing to the MERMAN recording of GYPSY then you really enjoy watching MIDLER as *****'s mother, ROSE. It's my opinion that ****** has the volume, vibrato and presents that ****** once had.<br /><br />It's not often these days, when listening to update versions of musicals, that I get that tingling sensation that makes the hair on my neck tingle but ***** ****** certainly shows her talents in this movie -see how you like them apples.....<br /><br />I know you may not like it, but for me Ms. ****** is the definitive "*****".
