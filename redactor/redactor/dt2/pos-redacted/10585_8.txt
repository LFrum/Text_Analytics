While some of the things in ******* are dumb and unnecessary, the overall package is good. <br /><br />******* follows **** **** and his friends Valo (*** Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to win back Glauren (**** ******), ****'s ex. <br /><br />The story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of Jackass or **** ** ***, although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story.<br /><br />And, for all the *** fan boys (And girls) there are multiple sequences of *** skateboarding, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even *** **** got a bigger (but pointless) roll.<br /><br />If you are hoping to see a comedy and escape ***'s craziness, then stay away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. There are some truly funny scenes in this film.
