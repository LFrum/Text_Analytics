Bride of ****** starts late one night as ******* *** ****** (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the evidence room at his police station & amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the ****** doll that serial killer ******* *** *** possessed way back in the original Child's Play (1988). He drives the remains to an isolated area where ***'s ex girlfriend ******* (Jennifer Tilly) slashes ******'s throat & takes the remains back to her trailer. There ******* stitches & staples ****** (voiced by **** ******) back together again & using a 'voodoo for dummies' book brings him back to murderous life. Thing don't go as ******* had hoped & ****** turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which ****** is less than happy. While ******* takes a bath ****** escapes, electrocutes her & using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride. Neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies & have to work together to get to a cemetery in New Jersey where ***'s natural body had been buried with the amulet needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies. The bodies of *******'s neighbour ***** (**** *******) & his girlfriend Jade (********* *****), who are both on the run from Jade's corrupt uncle Chief of police ****** ******* (**** ******), will do nicely...<br /><br />Directed by ***** ** I love Bride of ******. The script by *** ******* is great fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection. From the opening sequence where we see ***** ******** hockey mask from the Friday the 13th films, ****** *******'s razor blade glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series & ******* ***** mask from the Halloween franchise. To the clips used from Bride of Frankenstein (1935) when it virtually recreates the same scene. Bride of ****** never takes itself seriously which is just as well, there are lots of one liners, self referential gags that Scream (1996) made trendy a few years earlier & it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself & the horror genre in general. I love the scene when ***** & Jade are having a clich√©d slushy romantic conversation that ****** hears & he makes funny derogatory comments & gestures throughout. That's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is. ******** ** manages to create good atmosphere & a real sense of fun, both human & plastic sets of characters are likable & shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause. Technically Bride of ****** is great for the most part & has that big budget polish about it & at about $25,000,000 I should hope so. The only thing that I will say is that some of the puppet effects by ***** ****** are a little stiff & unconvincing, I can't remember any CGI scenes in Bride of ****** either. Thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood & gore with a cool slit throat, nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a Hellraiser (1987) homage, people impaled on shards of glass, someone being bloodily obliterated by a huge truck, a ripped off lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots. The acting is pretty good & ****** as ****** is very funny as he spouts the one liners out. I also like the scenes with ******* at the beginning & find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear, I can't be the only one surely? I personally think Bride of ****** is a fantastic film, total entertainment from start to finish, great humour & horror in equal measure & at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull. A personal favourite of mine, watch it as soon as you can!
