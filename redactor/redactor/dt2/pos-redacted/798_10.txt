I really like ***** *****. She may not be the greatest actress in the world but she's rather good in this. She play the dowdy, conservative, reporter to a 'T'. It's a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while. **** Fahey is also good as *****'s boss. I think given a decent break ***** could be a top actress. She's certainly no worse than some of today's leading ladies.
