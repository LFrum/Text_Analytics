"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film starring ********* ******, **** *******, ***** ******, ******** ********, and *** ****** *<br /><br />The story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child (Pardue) commits suicide.<br /><br />"Ordinary People" has been mentioned often in relation to this film; it's sort of "Ordinary People" with a role reversal. The mother in this case, ***** ****** (******) is more accessible than the father, *** (*******) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope. Like "Ordinary People," the younger son Tim (******) is the focus of the film.<br /><br />For me, the film was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment about it. There were some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (********) and some good offbeat moments. What never clicked was *** being any part of that family or having any chemistry with *****. This seems to have been the goal of director/writer *** ******. In one scene in a grocery store, the checkout kid assumes ***** is "about 30" and gives her his phone number. In almost the next scene, ******* asks ***** if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. ****** was 55 when this film was made, actually probably 54, and looks phenomenal. So what is *** looking at? However, there's something askew about ***'s complete detachment because the viewer doesn't really see how ******* ever WAS attached to that family.<br /><br />The end has a couple of twists and also some very touching scenes. Everyone is very good, with ****** and ****** being the standouts.<br /><br />There's not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this movie and lots of stares. The script could have been sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
