I agree that this film was spectacular. The way in which ***** **** captured, not only the impression of *** *******, but the essence of *** ******* really made the film. His life made a great story and it is good that it is finally being told. I also found a great interview with ***** **** about this role by ***** ******* from InnerVIEWS on KUHT, ******* ******* 8. The link is http: //video.google.com/ videoplay?docid=-3001837218936089620&q =innerviews+ jamie+foxx&hl=en . I encourage everyone to check it out, as it gives in depth looks into what went into his role and his personal feelings about *** *******. The only problem I might cite with the film is that the shotting style was rather bland at times, but in the end I think it helped make the story more realistic and keep the focus on the person, *** *******, rather than the film ***.
