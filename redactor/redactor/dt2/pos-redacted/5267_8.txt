Vidor shines as ******, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. Her brother, *****, is so downtrodden by their father that it's a surprise he's able even to tie his shoes, rather than asking Dad to do it for him.<br /><br />Other reviewers have already outlined the plot, so I won't rehash it; I will, however, point out that ***, who is pregnant by *****, is also married to him. This is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which would have been horrific by 1921 standards. The two are secretly married, but ***'s father, having been paid by *****'s father, tears up their marriage certificate.<br /><br />***'s death scene, with ****** in attendance, is a truly heart-rending experience, and highly charged with emotion. This scene alone is worth watching the movie for, but there's far more to the plot than that; why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same attention to the story?
