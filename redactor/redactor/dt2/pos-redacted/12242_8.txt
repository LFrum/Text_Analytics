******* ***** <br /><br />I have never seen comments on a movie, that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical viewings of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star rating. The movie follows **** ***** (***** ******), a television news producer. The network executive introduces *** ******** (******* ****), to study for the on air news anchor position. *** immediately charms people with humbleness. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, ***** ****** (****** ******). ****** knows all news stories, inside and out.<br /><br />The Network executive wants ******** on the air and **** argues, saying ******** is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to place ******** on the air, **** contacts ****** to get information on the news story and relays ******'s comments through an earpiece to ******** while ******** speaks. We watch the sharp contrast between ******'s/**** *****'s words and ********'s, as ******** skillfully rewords everything ****** and **** ***** say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. ****** gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from ********, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? This is something ****** does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly. <br /><br />******** coaches ****** and gets excited noting hundreds of ******'s shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. ****** never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what ******** taught him, causes ****** to have a panicked sweating attack ("**** *****") when he is on the air. ******** eventually becomes the top network anchor and ****** resigns prior to being fired. But ******** fails in his attempt for a romance with **** *****, because she finds out from ******, that ******** sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. This turns her off of him. This sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them. <br /><br />This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how ******** represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. The opposite is true, ******** possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (He coaches ****** to Punch a word in every sentence). ********'s flaw that costs him the relationship with **** *****, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. Many people are calling ****** very intelligent or brilliant. ****** played by ******* is not as intelligent as ******** and the "**** *****" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that ******** handles when on the air. ****** is angered by this fact that he knew the news and ******** suceeded more by getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.
