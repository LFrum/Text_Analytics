The first feature-length adventure of *** ******'s beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as ****** The Frog leaves his carefree, swampy surroundings for the bright lights (egged on by stranded Hollywood agent *** DeLuise who overheard him singing); on the way, he meets ****** **** (a pitiful stand-up comedian at ***** ******'s El Sleazo Caf√© who has Telly ******* for a bouncer and ******** **** a patron!), the piano-playing dog *****, bestial drummer ****** and his laid-back, funky band, egomaniacal beauty queen **** ***** (in a ceremony presided over by ******* ***** and ***** ******), etc. All the while, ****** et al are pursued by frogleg burger magnate ******* ******* and reluctant acolyte ****** *********, sold cars, ice cream and balloons to by, respectively, ****** *****, *** **** and ******* *****, served food by insolent waiter ***** ******, nearly brainwashed by mad German scientist *** ****** and, finally, land an audition in the offices of movie mogul ***** ****** (who has ****** ******** for a secretary)! The pleasant song score comes courtesy of **** ******** who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at El Sleazo's. For the record, I have recently acquired four of the subsequent Muppet movies and should be watching them in the weeks to come when their turn falls due.
