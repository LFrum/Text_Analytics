I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over. I adore each of the "******s" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC line-up. With the departure of ********* *****, the ****** stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even after 1989. Then they took a chance with **** ******. The movie was flawed, but it gave the BBC an idea of what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" was gone and the newbies at the BBC felt it was time to bring the ****** back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the Sci-fi Channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well, although the writers were having to start over and explain the Dr. Who mythology for new viewers. It is incredible to me that they have done it. In Season 1, staring *********** ********* with Russell T. Davis as lead writer, and **** ********* as producer, the ****** has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the ****** is. The ****** Who universe has always been about "Choice", "Love" and "Sacrifice". This is what they provided. It makes me want more and it saddens me that *** ********* has chosen to leave the show. My first ****** was ****** no. 3, *** *******'s ******. *** ********* needn't worry about his position in the Dr. Who universe. It is as solid as the rest. He is the 9th ******. I didn't know of *** ********* prior to his performance in Dr. Who, but I do now. I wish there was some way, he could know, there is push out in the Dr. Who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
