Odd one should be able to stumble into "****** **** *******" only by chance; it should be on any "best of film-noir" list, including IMDb's.<br /><br />**** ******* is as good as ever; knowing of his dire, delicate family situation gives extra weight to his almost expressionless face and brief dialogues. Belmondo's restrained performance under ******'s firm direction only shows what a wonderful actor he could - and should -have been.<br /><br />"****** **** *******" is utterly mininal, dry and cold, without ********'s artistic scenery, pretty faces and fancy cars. It is almost film-noir meet neo-realism. *****' few, hard words to his children describing their life of secrecy from there on get a hold on your throat to the end of the film. <br /><br />The final sentence of the film - a voice-over telling of *****' end in no more than ten dry, sombre words - leaves you with a hard punch in the stomach.<br /><br />A true jewel in the great crown of French film-noir.
