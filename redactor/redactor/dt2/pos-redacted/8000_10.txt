It's been said that ****** ****** in the first ****** movie to "get it right" but I think that's a horrible overstatement, for I think the new ****** film, although greater that ****** ******* and ****** and *****, pales compared to *** ******'s classics, with this one being the best of the five. The darkness is beautiful, as is the music and scenery, creating a ****** **** cloaked in mystery, unlike ****** ******, where ****** **** is a normal-looking city. The villains are terrific in this movie. You literally can't take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman. I applaud *** ****** for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak, rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old ****** TV show. In ****** ****** we have the scarecrow, whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman. The film doesn't need to focus only on ******, because we already know his story, and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out, and they are the ones who create the plot, with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents' desertion by killing the first born sons of Gotham, a task he fails. ***** ****** gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film, surpassing even *********'s joker. The closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful. It's a tragedy that *** ****** wasn't allowed to complete his trilogy, since ****** **** *, interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten" the ****** movies up. And they got their wish...unfortunately. *** ****** planned on directing the third film, using the Riddler as the villain, with no Two-Face and ***** to mess it up, and I'm sure ******* ****** would've signed on. So this is the last great ****** ****. ****** ****** is dark, but boring, tedious, ordinary, filled with lackluster villains, and a playboy ***** *****. A decent ****** film, but the best ****** film ever? Never. ****** Returns holds that crown.
