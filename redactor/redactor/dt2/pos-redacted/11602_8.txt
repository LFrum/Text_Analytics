The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes. Set in Bengal in the early 1900's, the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman, ******** becomes a widow within a year of her marriage, but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society. The film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps ********* *** is out of her depth in portraying ********'s strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness. ********'s idealism does not come across, and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried.
