Um, hello.. ******* *****.. the name alone is hard to take it seriously, like she could be the cousin of ********** Shortcake.. but when you're a kid, this is definitely serious stuff.<br /><br />So, there's this vile, snotty, spoiled girl and she wants ******* ****** belt, amongst other things, ie the light of the whole universe, and ******* ***** and her friend Cris are bound and determined to stop her. As I remember, ***** and ***** had a minor role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money?<br /><br />So anyway, snotty, evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels it's power to take *******'s belt.. imagine? But somehow, ******* gets her belt back and re-energizes it with "star sprinkles" and kicks the bad girls' butt with the help of Cris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process.<br /><br />So good triumphs over evil, niceness triumphs over rudeness, and ******* ***** and the Color Kids are once again safe to spread color and joy for all mankind.
