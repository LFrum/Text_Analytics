For many years, ****** ******* tried to bring his friend ****** ******* to the screen. One evening when ******* and his wife Frances were having dinner with ******* and his wife, silent screen star ******** *****, ******* proposed that ******* star in a movie. After some persuasion, ******* agreed, on the condition that his acting be kept to a minimum. And the movie, originally titled "***** ******" was born.<br /><br />The story itself is rather stock: A streetwise boy (Gene ********, who is best known as the producer of "M*A*S*H"), runs away from home and ends up at a financially troubled music school run by Professor Lawson (****** *******). While attempting to raise funds for the school, the boy and some other kids happen across ******* at Carnegie Hall. After much ado, ******* ends up appearing at the school concert and sponsoring the school. <br /><br />The story, while predictable,is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several minor gaffes where different scenes were patched together, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the orchestra room on an errand and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later.<br /><br />What is not surprising is how good the acting is. As was customary for studios then, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent: *******, **** ******, ****** *****, ****** ****, ******** **** (later of Ma and ** ****** fame), ****** ****, **** ******, and a Who's Who of character actors. ******* ***** **** and singer/actress **** ****** made their (uncredited) debuts in this film, as did longtime ****** **** singing partner **** ******** (as ********** ****). Child veteran actors ********, ****** ****** and ***** ******* also appear.<br /><br />******* hired the ***** ********* ********, a highly regarded youth orchestra from the Los Angeles Area, to appear in the film. Most of the kids in the orchestra weren't actors, but they were excellent musicians, as good as professionals (which many of them later became). Many of the kids in the orchestra went on to noteworthy careers: **** ****** and ***** **** both starred in the theater and movies, ******* ****** was a producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known music supply company, ******* ******** went on to be a prominent cardiologist, ***** ***** was a band leader, ****** ***** a conductor with different symphonies, Channing Robbins a prominent instructor at the Julliard School, his sister ***** ******* an instructor witn SUNY Stonybrook, and many of the kids in the orchestra pursued musical careers with major symphony orchestras.<br /><br />While *******'s acting was kept to a minimum, his salary wasn't. He commanded $70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be re-shot at a later date, he got an additional $50,000 for another four weeks. What thankfully wasn't kept to a minimum was his musical output. Composer ****** ******* (who was once a Meremblum Orchestra conductor) handled the scoring. ******* performs the "Introductionne and ***** ***********" by ******* Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of ****** *****'s "Estrellita" (with an off-screen ***** ********** accompanying), ******'s devilishly difficult "**** ********" (from a Vitaphone recording, with ******* *** at the piano), an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody", an excerpt arranged for violin solo from Tchaikovsky's well-known "****** *********" from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the movie), and the final movement from ***** Mendelssohn-Barthody's E Minor ****** ********. During all of these performances, there are many closeups of *******'s performing, including some very close shots of his fingering and bowing, something that would be of value to violinists desiring to study his technique.<br /><br />The Meremblum orchestra also shines here, performing the arias "**** ****" by ***** and "***** ****" by Bellini, (both with Sherwood singing ), an arrangement of the overture from *******'s "Barber of Seville", a short excerpt from Mozart's "**** ****** **********", and the previously-mentioned Mendelssohn concerto (with *******). ***** **** can be heard in the background of one scene, performing part of ******'s Nocturne in B-flat Minor, and a five year old Mary Ruth performs ******'s popular "Minute" Waltz.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent movie. AMC showed this regularly up until early 1992. I haven't seen it on television in recent years, but copies of it are not difficult to obtain. If you have the chance, I highly recommend that you view the movie.
