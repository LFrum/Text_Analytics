After cleaning up ***** **** (with a little help from ***** ****) *** ********* goes to Liberal, Kansas where they've got a nice little range war going. Plus a rather interesting scheme of sharecropping.<br /><br />******** ***** is *** ********* and he's after villains ***** ***** and ***** ****** who are driving homesteaders off their farms. The homesteaders they are driving off are in a sharecropping scheme financed by ****** ****. Seems as though he's staking the various farmers to a parcel of land to homestead for a percentage of profit from their crop. ****'s about to lose his shirt as a result of all the shenanigans.<br /><br />As portrayed by *****, *** ********* is a stand-up western hero who has a passion to go east and become a reporter which we all know he did later in life. <br /><br />**** ******** and ***** ******** are involved in a romantic subplot involving ****** and **** which is a little silly and does detract from the action. **** ******** does sing nice though.<br /><br />Of course ***** ***** as always provides the great comic relief.<br /><br />A good addition to the ******** ***** collection of westerns. Also interesting because his later western films don't have him as wearing a hat as white as the one here.<br /><br />This review is dedicated to ***** ***** of the Professional Bull Riders who is a proud resident of Liberal, Kansas, a town with a great tradition whether *** ********* marshaled there or not.
