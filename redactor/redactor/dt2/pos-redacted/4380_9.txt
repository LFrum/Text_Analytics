It takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. O ******* does that and then some. The first time I saw it, I have to admit I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I'm up to double digits with this great movie, the Coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with ***** and ********* ***** coming in a tight second and third for me.<br /><br />****** ******* gives the performance of his career playing ******* ******* *****, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. *** ***** ****** and **** ******** are the perfect sidekicks for *******, particularly ****** and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. **** ******* is my favorite bit character as Big ***, perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers' favorites ***** ****** and ******* ******* also provide memorable performances. <br /><br />Joel and ***** **** are masters of their trade. It's not like they try to win ******* ****** every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean loose for all of you Homer fanatics. It's just great.<br /><br />The most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. I've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and I am still in awe just thinking about it. The coloring does become an important part of the movie. Great great movie.
