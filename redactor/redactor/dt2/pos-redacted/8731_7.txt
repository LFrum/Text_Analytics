I was very surprised to learn that ****** **** won an Oscar for this film. She seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54(!) year old ******* in the scenes where they are side by side. If it had been written today, I think that ******* and the young man **** would have wound up together (Ingrid is so much hotter than Goldie...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by ******* and **** would be left out in the cold. But it was written at the end of 60's and feels like ***** ***** or Barefoot in the Park. However, *******'s one-liners, ****'s innocence and *******'s classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch.
