One year after 'Love Thy Neighbour' made its I.T.V. debut, it followed the route taken by 'On The Buses' and 'Steptoe & ***' by graduating onto the big screen, in a picture made by Hammer Films. It opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of England's green and pleasant land, then cuts to a shot of ***** and **** walking up a street, arguing furiously. This escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each other's homes. At least the original theme tune is retained ( even if it is sung by someone other than ****** ******* ).<br /><br />The local paper - 'The *******' - is holding a contest to find the best neighbours, the winners landing a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests to **** that they should enter. The thing is, can **** and ***** stay friends long enough to win it? That's the main part of the plot. The film is by and large episodic. One chunk is lifted directly from Season 1, namely **** and ***** going to the Club pretending to be on 'union business'. In reality they're going to see a stripper ( not meeting two girls ). Another portion of the movie has ****, along with other black factory workers ( in the series he was the only one ), breaking a strike ***** has helped bring about by various ploys ( including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels ). While another ( seemingly inspired by Powell and ******'s 'For The Love Of Ada' ) sees *****'s talkative mother ( the magnificent ******** ***** ) getting friendly with ****'s father ( ******* ***** ).<br /><br />The climax to Episode 1 Season 1 reappears in an expanded form. **** once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify *****, but his friends join him, and they dance round a drum containing a naked Booth, so that they can pretend to cook and eat him. ***** then has to make his way home in the nude ( surprisingly, there is less nudity here than there was in Episode 2 Season 2 ).<br /><br />The film ends with the Reynolds and the Booths winning the 'Love Thy Neighbour' contest, and taking the cruise together, but there's an unexpected twist involving ****'s sex-mad brother Cyril ( ***** **** - 'Private ******' of 'Dad's Army' ), who is working as a steward.<br /><br />This is your typical '70's sitcom-into-movie, with all the faults usually prevalent in such films. The laughs are scattered about, and interest wanes after about half an hour. The cast is augmented by familiar faces such as ****** ***** ( cast as ******', a character from Episode 2 Season 1, played on that occasion by ****** ******* ), **** ****** ( as the factory manager ), **** ******, ****** ******** ( who seems to have been in every '70's British comedy film, mostly cast as nymphomaniacs ), and ****** *******. The director, **** ******, was also responsible for the 'Man About The House' movie.<br /><br />Funniest moment - while ***** sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, **** paints his face black. The first he knows of it is when the manager's secretary screams in terror. The tables have been turned!
