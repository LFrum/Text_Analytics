****** Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of ***** *****' campy "Old Acquaintance" written by **** *** ******, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.<br /><br />****** and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. *** Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend ***** **** at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition. Later in their lives, when *** is a "promising" but blocked writer of serious fiction, ***** decides to try her hand at writing, which infuriates her pal because of *****'s casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously. <br /><br />Much to ***'s chagrin, *****'s trashy novels hit pay dirt, and ultimately, her old friend *** is judging her novel for the National Book Award. ****** steals the show as the haughty writer of steamy bestsellers who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in conjunction with her final literary triumph, but alas, things are never that simple.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes ***** *****, whom you might remember as the tragic ******* ******* from **** *******, **** ******* and, of course, a deliciously young and mercurial Meg Ryan in her first film role since leaving the soaps. <br /><br />**** and ****** is catty, campy, witty and wise. It culminates in a New Years fiasco that stresses the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never let a year go by without watching it on New Years Eve. Watch it and you'll see why.
