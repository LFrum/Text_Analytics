I really enjoy this film. It is a look back in time when this nation was truly at risk from nations who either attacked or delared war on us,i.e., the Japanese and Germans. ****** ******** and Pricilla Lane were excellent in the lead roles. The supporting cast... **** ******, **** ******, **** ******, and ****** ***** were also outstanding. The direction, pace, and finale held and continue to hold my interest. So much so, that I bought my own copy. Thank goodness for ****** ******* ******, they show so many of the truly classic films, including this one.<br /><br />****** ******** was certainly no light weight as an actor and although I am a great fan of **** ****** and **** ******, two of my favorite actors, who were first offered the lead role, I don't see what they would have brought to the role that would have surpassed *** ********' performance.<br /><br />This is a film that I enjoy watching repeatingly and urge others to view.
