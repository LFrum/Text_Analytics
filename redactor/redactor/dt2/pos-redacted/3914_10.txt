PEOPLE ARE STUPID.You shouldn't cheer when ***** gets killed in the head with a pipe! It is plain rude!What did ***** do to you? What if that was you? You wouldn't want people cheering for your death!Anyway it was really gory, which I liked and it was cool when ******'s finger gets cut off.It was weird with that twist that they didn't have 2 sons they had tree and all, It makes way for a House of Wax 2: Ressurction or something.***** was great acting in the chase scene.****** and **** chemistry is great, they deserve an Oscar.My friends and I were cracking up when that guy said that's hot when ***** and the guy from ****** ******* making out.Lol.K bye.
