Director: *** *******, Ford Beebe, ****: **** *******, *** *******, ***** ****, *** *******.<br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember. My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.<br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him. I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska. A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by **** *******. Really, this is a very good film with a great setting. It could be compared to the 1981 film ***** **** with ******* *******. The two films have a very similar story line. The main difference between the two is ***** **** is an adult orientated film whereas ********* is a family friendly film. <br /><br />**** ******* and *** ******* were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska. This was the last film made by *** ******* before he died which was just a few years later. They both had been around since the silent era.
