And nothing wrong in that! Heartily endorse the comments of boblipton and **** Leopard.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to find this movie is available on US DVD - I've only ever seen it through once - I persuaded the Goethe Institute here in London to show it in their Conrad ***** season some years ago - and long to see it again.<br /><br />Barrymore is resplendent when engaged, as in this movie, possibly because of the prick of having a renowned German actor as a foil. And ***** is such a wonderful scene stealer (doesn't he pick his nose at one point?) This is one of the seminal films to connect 'Dr ******' with '20th Century', 'Grand *****' or 'Midnight'; and 'The Cabinet of Dr ********' or 'The Student of ******' with 'The Spy in Bladk', 'Contraband' and 'Casablanca'.<br /><br />See it!
