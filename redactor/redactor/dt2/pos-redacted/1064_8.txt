Make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season! If you admire ****** ****** or ******* ********, this film is a fun one to watch. They really work well together as you would see in this movie. The whole cast was very entertaining. Since I'm a ****** ****** fan, this film was a real treat! But...everyone can enjoy it! Recommended!
