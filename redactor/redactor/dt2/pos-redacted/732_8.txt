Sweet young nurse ********* ***** (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout ***** *******) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr. ********* ** ******* (the excellent ********* *******). Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac ******* **** (the luscious ***** ********), loopy Judge ****** ** ******* (a gloriously hammy Gene ****), paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by **** ******), gentle giant Sam (the amiable ******* **** McGhee), and nutty old hag Mrs. Callingham (the supremely irritating **** ********). Said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by Dr. Masters, which of course results in a rash of brutal killings. ******** S.F. Brownrigg, working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by *** ****, does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia. ****** ******'s spooky score, the grimy set design, a few wild grisly murders, ***** ** ******'s grungy no-frills cinematography, plenty of deliciously robust, scenery-scarfing histrionics from a game no-name cast (**** in particular is a total eye-rolling hoot), and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70's low-budget regional horror exploitation cinema.
