One of quite a few cartoon ****** *** films, "****** *** and the Loch Ness Monster" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands of Scotland. One annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - American people trying to sound Scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well (although some people do better Scottish accents than others).<br /><br />****** has come to the Highlands to see her cousin ******* and the Highland games at Blake Castle. Gravely ******* tells the gang that she believes to have seen the Loch Ness Monster. When yet more chaos arises, the Mystery Inc Gang have another mystery on their hands...<br /><br />Good for ****** *** fans and for people who want to find out more about Scotland! Enjoy "****** *** and the Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
