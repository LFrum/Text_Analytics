I own a copy of this film and have always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of ******* **** earlier this week. That production was put on by the San Francisco Opera and starred ****** ***** and ***** ******. In the early '80s ***** replaced *** ****** as ******* (****** had won the Tony for his performance). I saw ***** and ****** ******** (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform ******* on broadway. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment I can ever remember in the theatre occurred when ***** sang "These are my Friends." ("These are my friends, see how they glisten." "My arm is complete again!") <br /><br />*****'s performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since I first saw him perform the piece on Broadway and later in the film. What a talent! He is sympathetic, funny, and scary -- all at once; and he can sing, boy can he sing. All of this reminded me of how terrific the film is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
