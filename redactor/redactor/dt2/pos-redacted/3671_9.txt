This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. ***** ***** is "Amazing" ***** *******, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like *** ****** as ***, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain. ******** Price plays ****** ***, a closet gay singer murdered by a cross-bow killer in Chicago. His valet-lover **** *******, played by the stunning ****** *******, must overcome ******'s siblings, including **** ********, who want to turn their home into a tribute museum, and teams with ***** and her dwarf daughter-in-law, ***** *******, to find the killer among the homeless of Chicago.<br /><br />The entire cast sing at various points in the pursuit, and are excellent, esp. the talented Price and *****. This implausible storyline, both funny and bizarre, is one of the most off-center films. Cameos by ***** *******, ***** ******, and ***** ***** ******* should tell you just how bizarre this film truly is. Strange, funny, and off-center but with a good perspective about people with every kind of difference.
