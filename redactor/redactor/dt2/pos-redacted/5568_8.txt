When I first saw the Premiere Episode of ********, I had no idea what to expect. I was immensely impressed and satisfied with "Premiere". Subsequent re-watches, however, have made numerous flaws apparent to me that I missed initially. "Premiere" is not a great ******** *******, but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters.<br /><br />The episode begins with **** ******** (*** *******), an astronaut and scientist, preparing to launch into space in the ******** Module, a small space ship perfected by ******** and his friend DK. ******** has a revealing conversation with his father, **** ********, and then begins his test flight in space. Of course, everything goes wrong and ******** is "shot through a wormhole" and winds up in "a distant part of the galaxy".<br /><br />After exiting the wormhole, ********'s module is pulled on board a living space ship. From here, the characters and story line for the ******** series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner.<br /><br />The regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode. Of course, there is ********, played well by *** *******. He offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with. He's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything. In "Premiere", ******** has to choose between joining the prisoners or the Peacekeepers. He knows nothing at all about either side, but in helping ***** (a captured Peacekeeper pilot) it becomes clear that he intends to help the Peacekeepers. He probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for *****, a Peacekeeper captain, declaring ******** to be the murderer of his brother. This puts ******** in an interesting situation: he's stuck with bizarre, violent escaped prisoners in a far-off galaxy about which he knows nothing at all. ********'s total lack of knowledge of the Farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during ********'s first season.<br /><br />The supporting cast is just as compelling. There's *****, a blue Delvian and former prisoner. She's peaceful and reasonable, as opposed to fellow prisoner Ka D'Argo, a powerful and hard-headed warrior. Virginia Hey is totally covered in blue makeup, allowing her character of ***** to appear cool and convincing. D'Argo's mega-makeup, in contrast, is below-par. He looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose, and there is something peculiar about his eyes. They look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup. ******** would give some improvements to his makeup in Season 1, but the overall costume would, for me at least, remain as a problem until Season 2.<br /><br />The puppet/digital characters of Rygel and ***** are, to put it simply, excellent. Rygel is a tiny ******** ******* who floats around on some sort of hovercraft. In "Premiere" he is given some good dialogue but not much else. ***** nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship, ****, and ****'s passengers. Even in the first episode, ***** gives off the appearance of being a real, living alien; he never once in the show seems to be a giant, expensive machine.<br /><br />The Peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well. The Peacekeepers are made up of a race called Sebaceans, who look just like humans. The chief antagonist is introduced in "Premiere" as Captian *****, who believes that ******** killed his brother. In reality, *****'s brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with ********'s ship. ***** Sun, a pilot who ******** helps escape, tries to explain that the death was an accident, but ***** just claims that she is "irreversiby contaminated" and refused to change his mind. ***** obsession for revenge, warranted or not (it should be clear to ***** that ******** isn't responsible), is mysterious in "Premiere", but would be explained later in the season. ***** herself provides an extremely interesting character. By being forced to leave the Peacekeepers, she changes her whole way of life, and is in that regard in a similar (though less severe) situation as ********.<br /><br />The actual episode, as mentioned earlier, feels somewhat rushed and clunky. So much happens that not enough time is spent on anything. Also, D'Argo (for now) looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing. Still, "Premiere" is solid entertainment. The special effects (such as in the starburst sequences) are impressive. Most of the costumes and the sets on board **** are original. Despite its flaws, "Premiere" is a must-see for ******** fans. 3/4
