******* was compulsive viewing from start to finish. The story centred on apparently random murders of men in London in various gruesome ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (*** *****)has to find the truth which, to his surprise, is a little closer to home than he might think.<br /><br />Gripping drama and *** ***** was brilliant. Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe.
