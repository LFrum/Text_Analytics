This is a case where the script plays with the audience in a manner that serves only in extending this story to 90 minutes. Story starts out in 1969 where a young girl named ***** (******* ****) travels to Europe with her boyfriend **** (*********** *********) but she dies under mysterious circumstances. Then in 1976 *****'s sister ****** (******* ********) decides to travel to Europe as well and try and find out what happened to her sister. In France she looks up **** who has stayed there and she wants him to help her retrace the steps her sister took and answer some questions. He is reluctant but decides to travel with her. Along the way he fills in the gaps of the occurrences and tells ****** that ***** had joined up with the Red Army who are an extremist group that is involved in terrorism. ****** and **** engage in a romance and this complicates the trip to Portugal where ***** died. Their is several things wrong with this film and it all has to do with the script. First, the romance between **** and ****** is all wrong and does nothing for the story. It rings completely false and comes across as forced. It seems weird that **** would engage in a romance with his dead girlfriends sister. Secondly, **** knows completely what happened to ***** but only lets out little chunks of information every 15 minutes or so. **** will look at ****** every 15 minutes and say, "There is something I didn't tell you"! Gee, thanks a lot ****! If **** had come clean the first time he talked to ****** then the film would have been over in about 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I don't think this film recreated the 1960's at all. **** wears hippie clothes but the time period just didn't ring true. I did enjoy a few things like the authentic locations where the film was shot. It is a very good looking film and the scenery is beautiful. The performances are all good especially by ******** and ****. Besides "The Fast and the Furious" I had never really seen ******** in anything. But after watching her performance in this film I came away very impressed. She's very good here and I hope better roles come her way. The script is told in a very contrived way and the film never comes across as believable.
