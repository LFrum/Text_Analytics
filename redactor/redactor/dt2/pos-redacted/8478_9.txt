But this film has plenty of rich performances by an top cast including:****** ****, ******* ******, ****** ********, ******** *****, ******* *****, ******** ****** and ****** ****** as ***'s mother. This is probably THE best film of Hackford's career to date. The film has plenty of song of *******'s best music as well.<br /><br />DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an excellent ***** ******* 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc 1 has an informative commentary by the director and the DVD also has the original theatrical cut and extended version as well. But u are better watching the theatrical version instead, because the bonus footage is in bad shape at times and u have to click on a logo if you want to see these Deleted Scenes. Disc 2 has deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director (***** is seen in the Extended Version), featurettes and more. But the featurettes are disappointingly short for this DVD. Since the movie is extraordinary good. This film was nominated four Oscars including **** ******* *******, **** ********, **** ******* and **** *******. This is an amazing true-life story well told but of course, *******' life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film. Still, it's pretty damn close. Screenplay by ***** ** *****. From an Story by White and director:Hackford. Oscar-Winner for **** *****. Don't miss it. (**** Â½/*****).
