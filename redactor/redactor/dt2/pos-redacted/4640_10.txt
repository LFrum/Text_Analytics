Still funny after all these years. Midnight Madness is good entertainment for all ages. It introduces ******* * *** as a typical 15 year old trouble maker. Melio and ******* are by far the funniest characters in it and **** is perfectly cast as a wierdo game master. The budding romance between **** and the girl couldn't have been any cheesier. Fagabeefe!!!!
