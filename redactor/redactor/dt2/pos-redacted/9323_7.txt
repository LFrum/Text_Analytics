Musical bios are all cut of the same cloth. Hopeful struggles, succeeds and finally wins the girl, but this one - a life of Irish tenor, ******** ******/Jack Chancellor - has more going for it than the usual trappings. It has great charm and great sincerity and is played beautifully by all concerned. ****** Morgan is fine in the lead as is ****** **** as his love interest. ****** King's supporting performance as ******* ******* is far better than ***** ****'s leading bio performance in the film dedicated to her career. ******* Frawley is touching as the aging tenor champion, ******* *******, and **** ******* is lovely as ******'s mother. ****** Tobias, *** **** and **** **** lend good support. There are over 25 songs (a true treasure chest): Come Down My Evening Star; My ******'s **** ****; You Tell Me Your Dream; **** **** *** *** ******, ******; Will You Love Me In December?; By The Light Of The Silvery Moon; Minstrel Days; ***** ***** ******; The Natchez and the ****** ** ***; **** ***** ***; If I'm Dreaming; *** **** of Killarney; ***** *****; One Little Girl; A Little Bit of Heaven; ****; ***** ***********; ******* **; When Irish Eyes Are Smiling; ****** *******; The Kerey Fair; Room In My Heart; My Wild Irish Rose.<br /><br />Although the film only earned one Oscar nom -for Scoring - and deservedly, it also deserved nods for *** ********* and ******* ****** - sumptuous and lovely in Technicolor.<br /><br />Reasons why this is not on video may be due to the large chunk of time spent within the Minstrel Show atmosphere -at least a quarter of the film - with a great deal of material quite politically INCORRECT for today's audiences. It's historically accurate, however.<br /><br />This is a true gem and very worth seeking out. It leaves one with a warm glow.
