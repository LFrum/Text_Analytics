Created in 1928, and originally named Mortimer before **** ****** changed his name (because his wife convinced him), ****** ***** has become the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature ******, it is in fact his third, but it doesn't matter, for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable. The story sees ****** piloting a steamboat until ******* **** takes him off the bridge, stopping to pick up cargo, and ****** ***** missing the boat. Being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them, ****** helps her crank it's tail and play the tune, and getting some other animals to be percussion, until **** comes along again to stop him, making ****** peel potatoes. ****** ***** was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!
