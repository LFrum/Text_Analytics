<br /><br /> It's common knowledge and has been said before: No one can ever play ******** and ***** like ****** ***** and ***** *****. ****** ******* ****** (no longer ****** having been divorced from ex-hubby *** ******) plays her own ******** and although this is a sequel and not a re-make (God-forbid!!!) she still cannot rise to the occasion (i.e. her voice sounds evil on several occasions, she's got brown eyes [******** in both novels had green eyes and even ****** *****'s eyes were green] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. ******** is a Southern Belle; therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in SCARLETT the novel and GWTW, of course) and to be a great flirt like ******** is, you would most likely need a higher-pitched voice, like ****** *****.<br /><br /> I suppose I'm comparing ****** to ***** a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as ***** did with ******** you simply can't help but to criticize any new prospective ********s. ******* ****** should have had no accent whatsoever, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's ***** and ***** in the film had none. His acting has never been truly noteworthy (except, maybe his portrayal of the evil, conniving King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little (if any) freshness or vitality to his *****. <br /><br /> Standouts in the cast are most notably **** ********* (a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance) as the tragic victim **** *****. And then of course there's Sean Bean as the cold, calculating and not to mention, almost demonically evil **** ******, ****'s nemesis and ********'s eventual violator. One thing I could not forgive the writer for was the fact that ******** is raped in this movie (a fact that never occurred in the novel; **** ****** is cold and of ill-repute among the Irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart. Another omission from the novel but readded for the film is the character of Belle Watling, played most horribly by Ann-Margret in a cameo role, which we all could have lived without, seeing as how the book was such a run-away bestseller without requiring any assistance from Ms. Watling.<br /><br /> For a film by itself, SCARLETT is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel. Another actress was highly necessary for ******** as well as *****.<br /><br />
