******** Wars is a hilarious, 12 minute short film parody of the original **** **** movie which was released just a few months after **** **** in 1977. This film uses household appliances as space ships and **** **** look-a-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter. This film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired *** ****** to write his **** **** parody movie called "Spaceballs".<br /><br />This is my favorite parody film and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with **** **** and has a good sense of humor.<br /><br />
