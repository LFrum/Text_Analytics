Or maybe not. Whatever anyone thinks of "********* ****," good or bad, almost all the credit for that "thinking" belongs to writer-producer-director ***** ** ******. As a screenwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to savage an entire business -- in this case, the "business" being television news -- but to do it with a smile, a wink, a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way. To do all that takes real talent, something *** ** ****** has in abundance.<br /><br />One user on this website, in his summary, asked the musical question -- "Did ****** ******** act like this?" Answerve: No! Of course not! And the reason for that is in Walter's -- uh, *** ********'s -- day, the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people. Same goes for **** ********** and **** and ***** and ******* ******* and ****** ** *****. Sure, they had to pay lip-service attention to their ratings, if only to please their bosses. But all they REALLY cared about was THE NEWS ITSELF.<br /><br />Now, of course, all that has changed. For the last 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that has really mattered is ratings, ratings, ratings. The bottom line. How many bucks will our news division deliver for the network? Don't believe that?<br /><br />Let's consider "The Big Three": *** ******, *** ****** and ***** ******** (aka "******* ********"). All three have now been on the job at their respective anchor desks for the last 15-20 years (***** actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job). Of the three, *** is the one with the greatest in-the-field training as a reporter. Personally, I think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions. All of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually IN those jobs. All three are now in their 60's (*** is pushing the big 7-0) and all three are still very good looking. And if you think they're still good looking now, imagine how good looking they were in their 40's, when all three were hired for (let's say, "put in") their current jobs. But do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been "put in" had he looked like, let's say, **** ****** ("****** *******"). Or like -- heaven forfend -- ME!!! Not only that, if *** were retiring tomorrow, a younger (than he is today) ****** ******** would not be able to get his old job back. Why? Not pretty enough. And it would matter not a whit that he is, or once was, "the most trusted man in America." <br /><br />And this is what "********* ****" is all about. *** Grunnick (******* ****), the next pretty-boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has trouble with a few minor things, such as thinking for himself, being able to write and knowing stuff. **** Craig (***** ******), the brilliant news producer with news business standards and ethics, all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty-boy-***. And ***** ****** (****** ******, no relation to ***** * *), a top-notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he "flop-sweats" behind the anchor desk. And many other such flawed characters whom you KNOW really do exist in the news divisions of the various networks.<br /><br />"*******" blazed the trail. Eleven years later, "********* ****" carried the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next movie to savage the business of network "news you can use" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.
