Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Much reviled when it first appeared, (inspiring the famous review 'Me No *****'), this precursor of "Cabaret" can now be looked at in comparison and it's not half bad. It's certainly no classic but it has its own wayward charm, (the film version of "Cabaret" follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat). One should, of course, resist the temptation to snicker when ******** ******'s Christopher *********, (it keeps the original author's real name; God Knows what ********* thought of it), describes himself as 'a confirmed bachelor' and while ****** is an utterly inadequate 'hero', (he's virtually asexual), and ****** Winters woefully miscast as ******** ********, (the part ****** ******** played in "Cabaret"), ***** ****** is a perfectly marvellous *****, (it's a lovely piece of comic acting), and ***** ******** is first-rate as Fritz, the German-Jew in love with ******'s character. Of course, if "Cabaret" had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again. That it has been revived may not quite be cause for celebration but it's perfectly acceptable all the same.
