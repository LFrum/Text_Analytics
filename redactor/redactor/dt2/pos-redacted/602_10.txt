*** ****** as ******, Dr.Teeth, ***** and Waldorf.<br /><br />***** ** as Fozzie, ***** and Animal.<br /><br />***** ****** as ***** ******, ***** the Frog, *** ******* and ***** Harry.<br /><br />******* **** as Janice, *******,****** and Scooter.<br /><br />**** ***** as *****, Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot.<br /><br />******* ******* and *** ****** *<br /><br />cameos by ***** ******, ***** ****, ***** ******, *** ****, ******* ***** and others.<br /><br />This is the first Muppet movie of the billion others that came out, and is also the best, by far! This deals with ****** the frog going on a trip to Hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way. This movie, along with being already good, has excellent songs performed by the Muppets, including ******* **********, Can You Picture That?, Moving Right Along and others. This movie, unlike the other Muppet flicks, carries a strong sentimental value to me. It's such a nice movie. Also noted is it's many cameos featuring ***** ******, *** ****** and a dozen others.<br /><br />my rating-A plus. 109 mins. rated G.
