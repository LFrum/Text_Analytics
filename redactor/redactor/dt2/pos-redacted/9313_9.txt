How is bear´s paw, elephant´s trunk or monkey´s brain for dinner? Let **** **** tell you in this wonderful and lighthearted comedy about the art of cooking the traditional(?) Chinese way.<br /><br />This movie shares the common structure of an American sports movie, but instead of focusing on baseball it centers around cooking which makes it all the more interesting. I even think ****** Cheung´s character look a lot like ******* ***** in Major League...<br /><br />This movie also contains a bit of **** *** **** vs ***** *** *** fighting (love seeing more of that after The Blade) and a quite funny in-joke concerning a Leon Lai pop song...<br /><br />Perhaps not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian though.
