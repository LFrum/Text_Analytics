I taped The Morrison Murders on ******** ***** network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, ******** ***** network and on Courttv. ******** Scarfe and **** ******* did a great job of playing **** and ****** ********. I am glad that ****** got his brother **** to confess of murdering his parents and their brother *****. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, ******** ***** network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, ******** ************ or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor **** ******** is in The Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders a ten because it is a good movie about ****** who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother ***** and at the end ****** discovers it was his brother **** who murdered his parents and his brother *****.
