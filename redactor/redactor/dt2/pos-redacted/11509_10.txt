The movie is about ****(Páll) a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital "Kleppur" and his friends. Victor(******) who during his education in England started to think he was ***** ******. Peter(Pétur) who took to much LSD and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity, he is obbsesed with China. *** Beatle (Óli Bítill) *** has spent most time at the hospital although ****** is slightly older then him, he claims he wrote every single ******* song and send it to them by telepathy<br /><br />The novel is better then the movie and covers all of ***** life from birth to his death, there is a long time since I saw the movie but if I remember it right the movie doesn't cover ***** childhood.<br /><br />"****** **********" is funny,sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it NOW! and read the novel first it makes the movie better
