I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm ******* ************* **** ******** where it ended up as one of the audience favorites. This is a spoof on the french cottage industry of OSS 117 films of the 50's and 60's. The first OSS 117 film based on the novel by **** ***** was brought to the screen in 1956, long before the first ***** **** film, staring **** ***** as ****** ********* ** ** **** and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with *** *******, ********* ********, ****** ******** and **** ***** all taking turns as Oss 117. **** Dujardin is in the title role in this comedic take on the series. As the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles Desny but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like Sean Connery. **** Fran√ßois Halim wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It borrows on the silliness of ***** ***, *** ***** and the Pink Panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and I am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived OSS 117 reworked to comedy adventures. ****** Hazanavicius directs. I would give this a 7.5 and recommend it.
