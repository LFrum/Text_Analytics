I honestly can't believe that this film isn't more highly rated. ****** ******* could be described as something like a French Alfred Hitchcock, and while this film is only the second one of his that I've seen (the first being ** *******), I can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films. The film is a French and Canadian co-production, and takes place in Canada. The cast is made up of British and Canadian stars and the high quality performances bode well with the rest of the film; most of which is high quality also. The film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station. After being questioned by ********* *******, it emerges that the young girl, ********, and her sister ****** were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only just allowed ******** to flee. However, as the investigation goes on, ******** goes back to the station to give new evidence, which reveals a far more shocking identity to the murderer.<br /><br />The performances in this film are excellent. ****** Sutherland is subdued as usual, but he suits the role he's given here very well and I wouldn't hesitate to name his performance in ***** ********* as one of his very best. The film also features supporting turns from British stars ****** ********* and ***** ******** who both give good turns; Pleasance in particular who shows just how great an actor he can be and highlights what a shame it is that he went on to waste himself in Halloween films. The unknown **** ****** also gives a great performance in her role as ********. The movie is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked. When ********* ******* discovers ******'s diary, the film turns into more of a drama in which the girl's last actions are shown; and while this section of the film is not as good as what went before it, it's still interesting and leads into a great twist at the end! Overall, ***** ********* is a great film that really deserves to be better seen. ** ******* is a better known effort from *******, but for my money this is at least as good! Highly recommended viewing.
