stars: ***** ******, ***** *******, **** ******, *** ******, Kate Mulgrew, ***** ******* and *** Reiner.<br /><br />After college class, teacher ***** (Crystal) wants his ex-wife dead and **** (******) wants his momma (Ramsey) dead. When ***** brings up that he wants his wife dead, **** knows what he must do for him, in order for a favor in return, for ***** to kill his mother. ****** is absolutely hilarious in this as the brain dead wannabe writer that has daydreams of poisoning his mom and sticking scissors through her head. He has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer. ****** was actually nominated for an ******* ***** for this because of her wonderful performance as mean old Mrs. Lift. Along with having comedy, the film also has heart. One scene between ****** and Crystal starts off seemingly as a joke, but goes deeper, actually making me slightly sad. ***** ****** directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction. For any fan of comedies I recommend this.<br /><br />My rating: B plus. 84 mins. PG-13 for ********, Sexuality and Violence.
