I saw this movie on TV back in the 60s and it still stands up well even after brilliant performances as a DI by R. *** *****, *** ******* and even ***** ****** (in a comic vein) on ***** **** USMC. I wasn't in the service but my brother had a recording of a Drill Instructor in the Air Force and it was scary. Others in the family who were ******* told me that ***** and even ****** were pretty spot on in their roles. The only thing missing in "The D. I." is the language. In 1958 they couldn't yet use profanity on film, yet **** **** came across pretty damned tough without it. I think it's his best role ever. In Dragnet he was quite stiff I'll admit, though not as bad as ****** ****, but he used it only to effect in "The D. I." You never forget the funeral for the dead flea! The romantic part was just to stretch the movie, but didn't really interfere with the basic plot. *** ******* was pretty good to but he never surpassed this film in his career. As far as patriotism, **** **** was TV's **** *****. He carried it a bit too far in some Dragnet episodes, but not in "The D. I." After 40 some years I hoped the film could stand up to the likes "Full Metal Jacket" and others; and it did!
