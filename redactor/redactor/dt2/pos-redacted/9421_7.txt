***** ******** and ***** ***** as Sherlock ****** and Dr. ****** respectively, the second of the Universal series, where it's again established by means of a written prologue that the famed detective is legendary and spans time. This helps to comfortably set things up here in the "present" era of the early 1940's.<br /><br />In this offering, ****** goes through a few different disguises (with ********'s very prominent features, is it likely that people really wouldn't recognize his true identity?) as he protects a physicist from the hands of the Nazis as well as from ******' greatest nemesis Professor ******** (now played by Lionel Atwill). The scientist has developed a bomb sight which will greatly aid in aerial bombardment, and he's promised his plans to the British. But ******** wants to get hold of it so he can sell them to the Nazis.<br /><br />A good entry boosted a bit by the participation of the properly villainous Atwill now cast as ******** (though ****** ***** was no slouch himself in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). It's always intriguing watching ****** and his greatest enemy engaging in witty banter together ("the needle to the last, eh, ******?").
