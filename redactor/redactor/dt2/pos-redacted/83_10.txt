Channel zapping one night I just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted child, ****, whose mother left him after birth. The movie takes us through his childhood, and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from ****'s past. I will not reveal more, but it is a very in-depth movie and will intrigue you for sure. This was one of ***** ***** best roles in my opinion.
