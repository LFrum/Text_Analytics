Another ****** ***** *******! This Picture hit the theaters November 10 1969 starring ****** ***** as *******, ***** ****** as *** and **** ***** as **** ******. ***** is on her way to meet with her girl friends ******* and ******. While on her way there, she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance. ***** walk away from him goes to the table where she sees ******* and ******. **** approaches her again and she starts to walk away when **** shoots her in the back. ***** is taken to the hospital while ******* and ****** go to the police station. ******* goes to the hospital where she meets up with ****** only to find that ***** died. **** then goes after ****** who he hits with a car and then tries to run ******* down. ******* jumps into her car and heads for Los Angeles. When she gets there, she calls ***** her boss in Las Vegas to let him know that she was all right. ***** tells her to go to the club called the losers to see **** about a job. However, there's one problem! The bartender has a drug problem and **** knows it so **** and the bartender have a little talk. Back in Los Angeles ******* not only gets a job as a dancer with **** but also hooks up with **** bouncer ***. Now some thoughts on this picture! This picture was far better then ****** last, and this one had nonstop action. **** ***** did a fine job of playing ***** ex husband. He was your typical murder with the look that goes with it. As for ****** ***** performance, the only word that comes to mine is fantastic. She was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before. The outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking. In fact, all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking. Of course, it doesn't matter what ****** had on because she looks good in everything or nothing. I give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons. The first and by far is ****** ***** who's the leading actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this movie was wall-to-wall excitement from beginning to end.
