"Don't Change Your Husband" is another soap opera comedy from Producer/Director Cecil B. ** *****. It is notable as the first of several films he made starring ****** *******. I guess you could also call it a sequel of sorts to his "Old Wives For New" (1918).<br /><br />***** (****** ******) and ***** (*******) Porter are a forty-ish couple where ***** has gone to seed and become slovenly and lazy. he has a penchant for smelly cigars and eating raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. ***** tries to get him to straighten out to no avail.<br /><br />One night at a dinner party at the Porters, ***** meets the dashing ******* *** ******* (now there's a moniker), the playboy nephew of socialite Mrs. Huckney (****** ******). She invites ***** to her home for the weekend to make ***** "miss her". Once there ******* begins to put the moves on her, promising her pleasure, wealth and love, if she will leave her husband and go with him. The sequences involving *****'s imagining this promised new life are lavishly staged and forecast ** *****'s epic costume drams later in his career.<br /><br />*****, bored with her marriage and her disinterested husband, divorces ***** and marries the playboy. ***** ultimately realizes that he has lost the only thing that mattered to him and begins to mend his ways. He shaves off his mustache, works out, shuns onions and re-acquires some manners.<br /><br />Meanwhile, all is not rosy with *****'s new marriage. ******* it seems likes to gamble and has taken up with the gold digging Nanette (aka Tootsie, or some such name) (***** ****). ******* loses all of his money and steals *****'s diamond ring to cover his losses.<br /><br />One fateful day, ***** meets the "new" ***** and is taken by the changes in him. ***** drives her home and becomes aware of her situation and.................................................<br /><br />This film marked the beginning of ****** *******'s rise to super stardom in a career that would rival that of **** ********. Barely 20 years of age, she had begun her career in Mack Sennett two reel comedies as a teen ager. ****** ****** was almost 50 at this time but he and ******* make a good team, although it's hard to imagine anyone tiring of the lovely Miss ******* as is the case in this film.<br /><br />****** and ****** ****** had appeared in the similar "Old Wives For New" where the wife had gone to seed and the husband was wronged.<br /><br />Also in the cast are ** ***** regulars Theodore Roberts as a bishop and ******* ****** as a gambler.
