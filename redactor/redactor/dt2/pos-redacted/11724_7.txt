**** ********' riposte to ***** ******** encroaching on his redneck comedy turf with his orangutan comedies was to make his own ***** ***** in Chicago-style thriller, ******'s *******. Originally intended for **** ******* but in the end directed by the star himself, it's an out-and-out commercial package with ******** a narc who gets busted down to the Vice Squad (literally - they're in the basement) who sets out to nail a mysterious crime lord who is backing **** ******** as the next governor. You can guess the rest, but while ******** tends to lose sight of the story at times he has a good eye for individual scenes and almost gets a performance out of Rachel ward as the high-class hooker he falls for. The romantic subplot is unusually well developed, there are a couple of good action scenes and some nice touches, such as having ******** *******'s lookalike villain a mirror image of the hero or ******** and a killer both staking out a witness from adjacent apartments in the same building. One of the star's better films from his glory days, it's no classic but it makes for a more than efficient Saturday night special.
