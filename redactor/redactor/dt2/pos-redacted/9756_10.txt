"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful throughout. The banter between *** ******** and ****** ***** is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today. Best line? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is obviously the archetype for ***** *****'s "****** ***". ****** N. ******'s black and white cinematography (particularly with the banditos' shadows) was striking. All I can say about *** ****** is, "***** *** for DVD!" You can go right to the scene where she is trying on sombreros and serapes and watch her standing in front of that mirror over and over again.<br /><br />Lest I forget, that **** ******* guy sings real purty, too.
