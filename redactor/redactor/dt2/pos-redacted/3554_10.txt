A cranky police detective suspects a French duke of being the infamous thief ARSÃˆNE LUPIN.<br /><br />**** & Lionel Barrymore costarred together for the first time in a motion picture in this intriguing crime drama. Alike and yet so different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other. **** plays his role with suave sophistication (when not in disguise) and Lionel is earthy & common in his portrayal, each obviously having a wonderful time trying to out act the other. Helped by a generous script, the outcome is pretty much a draw, with the viewer the clear winner.<br /><br />Although upstaged by the two male stars, ***** ****** is intriguing as the mystery woman **** finds naked in his bed. Tully Marshall gives a colorful performance as a silly nobleman with much to lose to the master criminal. ***** Armetta & ****** ***** are very enjoyable as two seriously inept security guards. **** ****** provides a sturdy presence in his small role as the police prefect.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited ****** **** as a guide in the Louvre during the climactic scene dealing with an attempted heist of the Mona Lisa.
