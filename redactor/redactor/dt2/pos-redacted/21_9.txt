"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful film, brilliantly acted by ****** ****** and *** *********. How in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major ******* ***** nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me, but it's nice to know the Academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while (of course, they gave the award that year to "Terms of Endearment"-- after all, they don't want to be accused of showing TOO much taste).<br /><br />****** ****** is a drunken ***********an actor in a production of "King Lear"; *** ********* is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights. It's both hilarious and piteous to see *********'s character showering ******'s with attention and affection, only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed, even up to the very bitter end. ****** and ********* work wonders together, and though ****** gets the showiest moments (he does get to recite *********** after all), ********* is the heart and soul of the film.<br /><br />Grade: A
