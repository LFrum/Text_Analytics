In this approximately 34-second ****** Edison-produced short, we see ********* ***** performing the Loie ******-choreographed "********** *****" in two different fantastical, flowing robes.<br /><br />***** was one of the bigger stars of the late Victorian era. She was featured in a number of ****** ******* shorts, including this one, which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894.<br /><br />Loie ****** had actually patented the ********** *****, which ***** performs here in robes (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand tinted in the film, presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era. Supposedly, the ***** films were popular enough to have to be frequently redone (including refilming). The version available to us now may be a later version/remake. ***** became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in New York City. She later went on to star as the "****** ******* ****" in the Ziegfeld Follies in 1907. She appeared there until 1912.<br /><br />The short is notable for its framing of motion, which, especially during the "second half", becomes almost abstract. It somewhat resembles a Morris ***** painting, even though this is almost 60 years before *****' relevant work.<br /><br />You should be able to find this short on DVD on a number of different anthologies of early films.
