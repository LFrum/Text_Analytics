'Doppleganger', ( or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late ****** ***** ) and produced by ***** and ****** ********, best known for their 'Supermarionation' television shows such as 'Thunderbirds'.<br /><br />The international space agency ******* discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. The committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. But when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the Russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.<br /><br />American astronaut ***** **** ( Roy ******* ) is teamed with British scientist **** **** ( *** ****** ). After weeks of gruelling training, the Phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.<br /><br />Three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. **** survives, but **** is badly injured. A light is seen moving towards them...<br /><br />I will leave the synopsis here. Until this point, the film has been gripping, with excellent special effects ( by ***** ******** ) and music by ********'s resident composer ***** **** ( why it has not been issued on C.D. is a mystery ). But when **** and **** crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact ***** & Sylvia later did something similar on their 'Space: 1999' show. **** risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to ***** - his *****. But why? The new ***** is so similar he might as well not have bothered.<br /><br />Roy ******* had recently done 'The Invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). *** ****** is good as '****', but vanishes from the story too soon. Several actors went on to appear in the ********s' 'U.F.O.' such as ** ****** and ****** ******. Blink and you will miss ******** ******** ( 'The *********' from 'Dr.Who' in a tiny role ). But the acting honours go to the late ******* ****** as ****** ****', head of *******. The character is not far removed from 'Sir **** ******', the one he played in A.T.V.'s 'The ***** ****'. Webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. ******* Lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.<br /><br />Like I said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. So the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another 'Planet Of The Apes' or - dare I say it - '2001: A Space Odyssey'.<br /><br />In ********'s productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching 'Coronation ******' every other night. How disappointing. If a mirror ***** really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. If all the women there look like **** ****** or Loni von Friedl, I will be on the next flight!
