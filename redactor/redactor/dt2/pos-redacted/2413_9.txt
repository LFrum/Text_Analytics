For once a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without ***** *******! ****** ***** did an excellent job playing the orphan ***** ******. *** Morita, the one who plays *** ****** worked his way with ***** quite different from ******. Both ****** and ***** favored karate. Unlike ******, ***** was the most surly person ****** ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when ***** came home from school, ****** went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process. That was very funny! And the classic "*** on, *** off" scene was different as well. It was funny when ****** tells *****, "Uh-oh, missed spot". The set in Boston was a far cry from California. The Militant group in that group, was like the "***** ***" in Boston. And ******* ********'s Col. ***** was no **** ******. His group practically deserted him when ***** kicked some serious butt. They all paid the price when they blew up that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they'll find redemption from *****'s poison. This Karate Kid sets some morals, unlike the last three, which talked about "Honor" and "Respect". ****** ***** is outstandingly hot in any movie and everything else she does. Movie 9, ****** ***** 10!
