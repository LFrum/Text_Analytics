This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is good fun, not great but entertaining.<br /><br />Based on a song by Rogers & **** that was an enormous hit at the time, the story revolves around dance hall girl ******* ******** who is romanced by wealthy businessman ******* ****** (who was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor ****** ******. She and ****** marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses ******, who still holds out hope. She helps hubby get a job in ******'s company, but married bliss quickly turns sour as ****** develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high-stakes bridge (Yup! I know, it's pretty funny....). Finally he embezzles $5,000 from ******, and is about to go on the lam, when his devoted wife goes to ******....and I won't reveal anything else, although the ending was certainly a surprise.<br /><br />******** is the best thing about this movie; in one of her earliest roles she's quite accomplished. ****** is the weak point; he's unattractive and sniveling, while ****** is amazingly suave and sexy, while his performance is earnest but unremarkable.<br /><br />While ostensibly a drama, it's filled with laughs, many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly. But there are a lot of good witty lines; at one point ******** says to ******, "My brains are in my feet, while yours are in...." That's pretty darn suggestive for 1931! There's a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick, in the last days before the Code clamped down and whitewashed everything. An amusing antique, a good reminder of how far we haven't come in 70 years....this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.
