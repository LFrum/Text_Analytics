***** ****** is a very unique film amongst **** ****'s work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by **** **** himself, the story that was elaborated by ***** ****** and director's son  ******* **** and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, ***** ****** is the film **** **** called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to ******* ********, his favourite was nonetheless ** ******* ********** and not any other.<br /><br /> ***** ****** has all ingredients one might expect to find in a **** ****'s film. Wonderful cast delivering his best, thou not featuring any major stars, except the most `fordian' of all actors  *** *******. Very peculiar small characters, who provide an obligatory comic relief, and ***** ****** has quite a few of them such as horn blowing ****** ******* (**** *******) in her shot but very inspired gigs. And last but not least legendary Monument Valley with **** ****'s fifth passage through it after **********, ** ******* **********, Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.<br /><br /> The film starts with two friends cowboys ****** **** (*** *******) and ***** ***** (***** ***** **) being hired to be ***** ******* or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers who are headed to ****** ******, a place that's for them like a promised land. On their way they are joined by a very peculiar Dr. ******** **** (**** *******) with two beautiful women, who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into Cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the Marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery.<br /><br /> Overall ***** ****** is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of **** ****'s wonderful Westerns. A must see. 9/10<br /><br />
