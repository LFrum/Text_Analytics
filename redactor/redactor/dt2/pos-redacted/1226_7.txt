This movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to businesses. ** Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war serving his country and now just is being helped out making a living by his friend **** ******** (**** ******) making sure he does not loose his house. **** tells him that this wasn't the life his parents were expecting for him and he should be living a better life than he is now with his brother ***** ******* (***** ******). Telling ** that him and ***** have always been family to him and would do anything to help them out, **** tells ** about a plan to make a heist. The money would be around 43 million split six ways among the other transport men too, although ** does not like the idea he tells his friend **** as long as no one gets hurt he would be in. The last night ** was forced to talk to a welfare lady about putting up his brother in foster care giving him a dilemma to lose what matters most in his life. Although the plan sounds safe at first, greed isn't everything when it comes to taking lives.<br /><br />When it comes to heists, your either in or your out, so when you don't go with a plan its hard to play the hero and stop greed driven people when it comes to having large sums of money. This movie comes with a star studded cast to keep you interested starring **** ****, ******** *********, ****** *******, **** ****, ***** ******, and **** ***********. Short I have recently only remembered him in "Stomp the Yard" which was about a kid who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college. This was probably one of his best movies I have seen him in and this one he fits the character so well it's great to see him on the big screen again in action.
