This is a modest ,unassuming traditional Western with a formulaic plot about opposition between ranchers and crop farmers around the town of Liberal ,****** .The story is essentially routine and features a number of the classic Western conflicts .There is the farmer versus the cattleman;there is the clash between cultivated land and "civilizing" tendencies on the one hand and the wilderness/frontier ethos on the other and what this represents ultimately is the opposition of two value systems -democratic and community values as set against rugged individualism .<br /><br />******** ***** plays legendary lawman Bat ********* who rides into Liberal at behest of a land agent (****** **** ) to help him sort out the bad guys who are the hard drinking ,brawling cattlemen .The two men quarrel but reunite to tackle the troublesome elements in the town .<br /><br />The script is clich√©d but the action is propelled along with vigour by director *** ******* and there are solid performances all round .In addition to rugged performances by the male leads there is comic relief supplied by ****** ***** ***** ,an oily villain nicely played by ***** ****** and attractive contributions from ****** ******** as a prim and proper Easterner wooed by **** and **** ******** as a saloon singer As long as you do not place a premium on originality this is good sturdy entertainment for Western lovers
