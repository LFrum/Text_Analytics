****** ******* had been a star of the screen for several years when talkies came in, and what a boost it was to his career. His Oxford English accent is so enthralling I could listen to him recite the farmer's almanac and not be bored.<br /><br />******* plays ****** ****, a 30ish playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time womanizing and gambling. Yet, he's a likable rogue - not only likable from the standpoint of the audience but by family and friends too. He has yet again gone broke due to his constant gambling and sells off his possessions in a foreign location to settle his debts and provide passage back home to England. When he gets there, he at first is met by a father who insists he'll kick him out - he's had it with ****** and his layabout ways. However, five minutes alone in a room with ****** and his charm, and ****** is not only forgiven by dad, dad has given him one hundred pounds to boot.<br /><br />****** then goes for a day's recreation with his sister and her friend, ******* **** (******* Young). ******* is set to be engaged to the Grand Duke Paul that very night, mainly just because her dad wants royalty in the family, and there is nobody else special in her life. That changes after her day with ******, and soon there is a scandal brewing as ******* refuses to go through with the marriage as planned.<br /><br />****** ******* is always a delight to watch in these early talking films he did for *** ******* where he is playing the confident adventurer or cad or both. He has a demeanor akin to ***** *****, but he is unable to display *****'s physical agility due to a disabling wound he received during World War I. However, what he lacks in physical agility ******* always made up in agility of soul. ******* Young, only 17 when this picture was made, shows the beginning of her trademark sweet girl that can erupt into a ball of fire when the occasion calls for it. ***** Loy plays ******'s girl from the past - **** ****** - a showgirl. Here ***** is still playing a part similar to the exotic vamp parts she got stuck with so often over at Warner Brothers when she was a contract player from 1926 until shortly before this movie was made in 1930.<br /><br />This is pretty much a light and breezy romantic comedy from start to finish. If you're in a mood for the kind of escapist entertainment that lightened the hearts of audiences during the Great Depression, this little film fits the bill.
