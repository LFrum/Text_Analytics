I saw this last week during ***** ********'s book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a ***** ******** sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny. *** ***** was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. ***** ***** plays a mad scientist who saves/brings ***** ******** back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-KGB turned cabbie. ***** ******** spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie has all the great ***** ******** slap stick and humor. The movie is somewhat predictable, I knew once the wife was killed that she would be sharing a brain with her killer. However I didn't go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a ***** ******** sci-fi movie and I was not disappointed in the least. I highly recommend that you go see him on his book tour or wait and watch it on the sci-fi channel next month. Although before the movie he said the Sci-Fi channel did cut some of the movie out to make it TV friendly. If you are a fan of *****, I highly recommend it.
