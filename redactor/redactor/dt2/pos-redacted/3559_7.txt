Bounty killer ****** ******, smooth Mexican bandit ******* ****** (who's great), and bank representative *** ****** each try to outwit one-another while searching for a large amount of gold from one of Roland's train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang.<br /><br />Though not the greatest that the genre has to offer, It's still breezy enough with a lot of light-hearted, action-filled fun and a satisfying finale.<br /><br />Any Gun Can Play is mainly remembered for it's opening gag where ****** ****** easily guns down three outlaws resembling ***** ********, *** *** *****, and Django.<br /><br />The next year, ****** and Roland were reunited alongside *** ****** and ***** ****** in the highly recommended The Ruthless Four.
