I love this film, it is excellent and so funny, *** is FIT and i wouldn't mind meeting him on holiday!! I rate this film a 10 because its gr8 and i hope they never re make it because it would never be the same. Funny bit is wen ***** is looking at the moon,and he shouts at ****** to 'come outside and look at the moon' that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old. Another thing is ****** looks a lot older then 14... but shes a gr8 actress. But i need help with something Does n e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen ****** and ***** are dancing??? Its really bugging me because i want 2 no what it is because its a nice song!!
