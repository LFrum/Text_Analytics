**** ******** as ***** ****** is the COVER GIRL du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in ***** *******'s club, the most special one according to ***** (**** *****) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. Take for example, Vanity magazine magnate **** ******* (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to her grandmother ********* (also played by ******** in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and *********. He doesn't believe that ***** could give Rusty happiness, or everything she should be entitled to--he even gets ***** believing this himself. When Rusty shoots to fame as Vanity's 'Cover Girl', ***** drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of Noel ******* (*** ******). So what happens when ***** returns to town with his sidekick Genius (**** *******) in tow, only to discover that Rusty is marrying *******?<br /><br />As a musical, COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by ****** **** and Ira Gershwin, including the Oscar-nominated 'Long *** and *** ****' (possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully, sweetly sung as a duet by ******** and *****), *********'s number 'Sure Thing' (the more lacklustre 'Poor ****' isn't a Kern/Gershwin collaboration) and 'Put Me To The Test'. The dancing, of course, is top-notch, since **** ***** had more than just a hand in the choreography. It shows in the simplest of dances, for example his dance with ******** to 'Put Me To The Test', or the joyfully exuberant 'Make Way For ********' number (performed by the trio of *****, Rusty and Genius)... which foreshadows the reaction ****'s character has to the police cop in the title number in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. ***** especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the 'Alter-Ego' dance. Like its successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (***** the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity ***** brought to the modern film musical: wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn't be showcased on a stage, and years before CGI, ***** insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style--himself. The number is hardly five minutes long, but it (and *****'s genius) still takes one's breath away, even sixty years down the line. This is the reason I watched COVER GIRL, and if nothing else, this dance is truly worth it.<br /><br />You can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto COVER GIRL and **** ********--not that she doesn't deserve it. Witness the scene when Rusty hits ********--the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for Rusty's entrance. ******** is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film, and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of *****. (Very few of *****'s co-stars have that honour.) She is hilarious in some scenes, for example her drunk scene when **** and ******* come to get her from Joe's.<br /><br />For some reason, however, her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity. That curse is only lifted whenever **** ***** is on the screen (dancing or no), or when *** ***** as ****'s long-suffering secretary 'Stonewall' sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation. Since the film, in the end, belongs to ********, neither ***** nor ***** can save it as a whole. This isn't to say that the film is bad--it isn't. It's enjoyable, with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at. But it's just not quite a classic. The dancing is classic though--so watch COVER GIRL for that, and you won't regret it.
