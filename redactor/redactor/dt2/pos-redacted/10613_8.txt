It's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young **** ****** in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved & detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly uses all those around him. However in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act, when ****** must make like the Flying Dutchman, he's much less comfortable.<br /><br />But his way with an epigram is peerless, and ***** & Macarthur have given him some gems (Macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair).<br /><br />The film is superbly lighted by the great *** ******, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. ***** and ********** cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. (NOTE: H&M themselves have blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene).<br /><br />The most notable supporting player is the one and only ********* ********, notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and ******, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher ******.<br /><br />Curious that ******** would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary ********* ***** *****, of which he was a founder, and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member.<br /><br />The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to ******'s imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. It's ******, ********, and the dialogue you remember...
