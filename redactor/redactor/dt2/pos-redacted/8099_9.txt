******* stars in a dual role as a jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator ******* ******, (i.e ******) A movie made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way won by the allies..it was banned in Germany by ****** and was a risk in a way for ******* because if the war was lost, he surely wouldve been sent away to be "reeducated"<br /><br />A funny satire with the classic scene of ****** tossing around a giant balloon of the world..good fun but with a message..a little preachy in the end. This was the last movie with *******'s trademark little mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9
