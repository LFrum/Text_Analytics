Back when I was working person, I remember having a really obnoxious client to deal with who insisted on making everything on a personal basis. I was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed I was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his. I swear but I was thinking of this guy as I watched **** ********* and ***** ******** in their battle of wits.<br /><br />In The Line Of Fire casts ***** ******** as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when **** ** ******* was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's ******** and partner ***** ********* who draw the case.<br /><br />But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. **** ********* earned a deserved ******* ***** nomination for **** ********** *****. He lost that year to ***** *** ***** for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but that I thought ********* was better.<br /><br />Oddly enough ********* might have been better off, but he saw ******** as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls ******** throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while what ********* says and does causes ***** to get real personal. <br /><br />The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. A guy like *********, a professional with a real or imagined grudge, is the most dangerous kind of foe.<br /><br />Others to note in the cast are **** ****** ******** as the White House chief of staff (and would be president in real life), **** ***** as another agent who falls for the ******** masculine charm, **** ******* as the Secret Service head, **** **** as the White House head Secret Service guy, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and *** ****** and ***** ****** as the President and ***** Lady.<br /><br />But when ********* is on he owns In The Line Of Fire. The climax with him and ******** is unforgettable.
