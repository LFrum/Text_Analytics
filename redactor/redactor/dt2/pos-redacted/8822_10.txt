I watched fantabulosa! because over the last few years ******* ***** has become one of my favourite actors, and if you haven't seen him in anything before firstly shame on you, and secondly get your hands on a copy of either Heartlands or ***** ****** ****. This production did not disappoint - ******* ***** transformed himself almost magically into ******* ********, and gave a performance that was as tragically moving as it was skillful. Not to take anything away from the other performances but like *******, ******* truly stole the show. I don't know how he does it, but every performance I have seen ******* give he seems to metamorphose until the character he plays is truly, utterly believable, and no matter how hard I try I cannot fault him. Must go get my tea, enjoy!
