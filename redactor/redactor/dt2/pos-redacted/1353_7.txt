The title role of this western is played by ****** ******, Jr. He's a young gun who with partner ***** ********* gets separated after doing a contract hit on a Mexican general. In eluding their pursuers ********* and ****** become separated. ****** comes upon the camp of lawman ****** ******* who takes a liking to ****** and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.<br /><br />This is the first of two films ****** ******* did with writer/director **** *******. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /><br />Not that ***** ***** ***** does not have its moments of hilarity. But it is a tripartite story involving the ****** reclamation, *******'s hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving *******, ***** *********, and town boss **** Kelly.<br /><br />The film abounds with nepotism. ***** ********* is ****'s son. **** ******'s daughter ***** is in this, ****** is the son of ****** ****** and ******** ***** and *******'s son ***** plays *******'s son in some silent flashbacks.<br /><br />****** ******* got his start in westerns and always looks right at home in them. ***** ********* essentially repeats the role she had in Rio Bravo. ****** had a brief career playing rebellious youths and doing a good job at it. I've often wondered what happened to him. He looks hauntingly like his father. Maybe he didn't want to come to such a tragic early end like his father.<br /><br />And it that wasn't enough, ******* fans get to hear old rumple eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film.
