This is the very first ***** ******* short with ***** that I saw, and it is one of my favorites! <br /><br />That is what I really liked about ***** when he returned after *****'s stroke, he did not try to be like *****, he was his own character, and that is what I admire! ***** is my favorite third stooge, I like him more than *****, but I like ***** as much as I do *****. ***** is great, he's funny, he's silly, he's SHEMP! <br /><br />I really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and *** got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting tangled in the wires and really badly hurt! <br /><br />But what I really thought was scary was when ***** had his face smashed against the glass of the phonebooth, he looked like a deformed Professor Snape!<br /><br />Poor *****, he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short, but that is just typical ***** *******, they always have a lot of bad things happening to them! <br /><br />This short is another must see for ***** ******* fans! <br /><br />10/10
