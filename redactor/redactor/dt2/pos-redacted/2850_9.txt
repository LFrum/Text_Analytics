I was mighty impressed with ***** ***** all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.<br /><br />If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was ****** ******* and ***** ****'s interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see **** isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like ****** ****** 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore. Hell, Kiss the ***** was watchable with him in it.<br /><br />***** ********** does the best she can with her role, and ******* is good as her obession.<br /><br />Sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male. 9 outa 10<br /><br />
