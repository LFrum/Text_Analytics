***** ***** goes to Atlanta is what **** called this fantastic, first-rate detective thriller that borrows some of its plot from the venerable **** ******* movie "Laura." Not only does **** ******** star in this superb saga but he also helmed it and he doesn't make a single mistake either staging the action or with his casting of characters. Not a bad performance in the movie and Reynolds does an outstanding job of directing it. ***** ***** is truly icy as a hit-man.<br /><br />Detective *** ****** (**** ********) is on a narcotics case in underground Atlanta when everything goes wrong. He winds up chasing a suspect and shooting it out with the gunman on a bus. During the melee, an innocent bystander dies. **** Woo's "The Killer" replicates this scene. Anyway, the Atlanta Police Department busts **** down to Vice and he takes orders from a new boss, Frisco (******* ******* of "Oh, *******, ***** *** ****?") in the basement. ****** winds up in a real cesspool of crime. ****** and his fellow detectives Arch (****** *****) and Papa (***** *****) set up surveillance on a high-priced call girl ******* (****** **** of "After ****, ** *****")who has a luxurious apartment that she shares with another girl.<br /><br />******* is seeing a local politician Hotchkins (Earl Holliman of "Police Woman") on the side who is campaigning for governor but the chief villain, ****** (Vittorio Gassman of "The ***** Game") wants him to end the affair. Hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate ******, so ****** has cocaine snorting ***** ***** (***** ***** of "Wipeout")terminate *******. ***** blasts a hole the size of a twelve inch pizza in the door of *******'s apartment and kills her.<br /><br />****** has done the unthinkable. During the surveillance, he has grown fond of ******* to the point that he becomes hopelessly infatuated with her. ******'s mission in life now is to bust ******, but he learns that ****** has an informant inside the Atlanta Police Department. The plot really heats up when ****** discovers later that ***** shot the wrong girl and that ******* is still alive! ****** takes her into protective custody and things grow even more complicated. He assembles his "*******" of the title to deal with ****** and his hoods.<br /><br />******* ******'s widescreen lensing of the action is immaculate. Unfortunately, this vastly underrated classic is available only as a full-frame film. Fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the picture, especially during the mutilation scene on the boat when the villain's cut off one of ******'s fingers. This is a rather gruesome scene.<br /><br />**** never made a movie that surpassed "******'s *******."
