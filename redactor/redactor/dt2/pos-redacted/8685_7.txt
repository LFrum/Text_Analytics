algernon4's comment that Ms *****'s "ultra lewd dance in (this film) is the most erotic in the history of films" is certainly one doozy of an exaggeration. It isn't even ***** *****'s most erotic dance. Her near nude gyrations in Fritz Lang's "The Indian Tomb" make this number look decidedly tame. As for being the most erotic in the history of dance. Well! Where do I start? ***** *****'s performance as ********* *********** in "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); ***** *** ****** in "True Lies" (1994); ******* **** in "*** ****" (2005); **** ******* in "****** ******" (2007); ****** ****** in "Dancing at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I love the sequence and have included it in my "********** *****" series on Youtube. I just think that making a claim like "most erotic in the history of film" is really going out on a very fragile limb.
