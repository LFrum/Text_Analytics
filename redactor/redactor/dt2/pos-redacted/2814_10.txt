At initial thought, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag, just for **** ***'s amusement. I expected nothing more than a sleazy, animated version of **** **** with low production values, much like those short pieces of crap you see on ***** **** for short term amusement, but can never taken too seriously. *** was I wrong!<br /><br />Stripperella has even better production values than similar ****** *****. The animation is very good and it seems that they've taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible.<br /><br />The humor is good too, on the sexy, suggestive and sleazy side. It is very similar if not exactly like the Simpsons style. You may encounter clich√©s and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless. If this were running today, I'd surely see it regularly. Its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made.
