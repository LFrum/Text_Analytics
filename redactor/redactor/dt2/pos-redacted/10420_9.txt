The director, ***** *****, delivers the goods with Somewhere in the City. This hilarious farce, I believe, is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. Niami pokes fun at New York society by creating the believable, eccentric, and tragic characters of one tenement apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them. ***** Stormare's performance as a gay Shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the hopelessness and laugh-ability of self-centered ambition. ****** ******** is cast perfectly as the straight, self-obsessed therapist. I really enjoyed ******'s performance immensely especially since I haven't really been a very big fan until now. *** Ling, ******* ****, and ***** ***** round out an international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with ****** **** ***** and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. With a cameo appearance by ***** ** **** and a solid performance by **** ******* *******, the revolutionary momma's boy, Somewhere in the City entertains without missing a beat.
