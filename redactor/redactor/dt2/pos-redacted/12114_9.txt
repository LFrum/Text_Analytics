Yes, I know, ****** ******** didn't like to be called 'Fatty', but I couldn't resist the joke.<br /><br />This is a fine ***** ******** short from his peak period, directed by ******. The two work together with lots of good gags and ******'s usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting manner. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a still camera to make them more interesting. ****** uses a couple of long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to tell his story and to show *** as a fine actor, as well as a talented comedian.<br /><br />This story plays with some interesting themes, like *****'s classic MOVE ALONG: here it's about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies make of them. Or you might choose to ignore such issues and laugh your head off.
