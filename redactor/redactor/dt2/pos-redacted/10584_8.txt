I bought this movie just to see *** because i was really loving him, but after seeing this i don't like him much. I mean, his acting was good and everything i guess, but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself, "Alright, we know you're a professional skateboarder, now can we get back to **** ****?" Dunn, ****, and ******* really made the movie in my perspective.<br /><br />I noticed that **** ******, (obviously), and ***** ********* were both in *******, but who *** was dating at the time? Anyways, i actually enjoyed ******* and i think it's really like no other movie i've ever seen. It's sort of in it's own category.
