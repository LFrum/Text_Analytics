Lifeforce is certainly one of **** ******'s best films. It has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it seems like a typical horror fan's dream. The film is quit creative though and I think that's because of the script from *** ******** and *** ******. Nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film.
