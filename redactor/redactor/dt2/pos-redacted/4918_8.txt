I gave this show a chance because of ****** *****, not for his ***** character, but mainly for the Sonic the Hedgehog voice XD So anyway, like I said, I gave it a chance, and I was very fond of it. I never cared for the ***** character, so I was pleased to see *** ***** in a role other than the ever-so-annoying nerd. And his ****** ** ******* (first called Calvin, but come the second episode, everyone started calling him "*") was very entertaining and interesting.<br /><br />I think my favorite episode was when * was dating the ex-Cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid. ("Don't you talk that way 'bout my momma!" "This is grown-up talk, you stay down there!") The only beef I have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters, but *** *****'s character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) always had the back stories... It isn't exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to *. having to babysit his girlfriend's dog.....<br /><br />Other than that, I really wish this show could have lasted a little longer. Unfortunetely, it seems that people weren't interested in ****** ***** as something other than the God-Awful annoying ass nerd known as *****....<br /><br />Hope they at least put it out as a DVD box set.
