There are so many episodes that make me howl over the stories<br /><br />that I wish I could pick the best ones , ***** and **** make for a strange pair that are beyond help but manage to play the victim and BS their way out of hard time just to drag *** into their life of crime .<br /><br />Canadians will notice the odd joke for Toronto or the Federal Government, and because the CBC axed a really good show by the Frantics that *** was part of , the show takes shots at them and in the episode "***'s Umbrella" the CBC is raked across the coals .<br /><br />When *** says that the CBC would never waste taxpayers money on useless venture , ***** enters the room and gives *** back his Tape of Friday-Night with ***** ********* , this show was a flop and most people wouldn't get the joke unless they knew the CBC's history for making shows people don't watch or axing good shows that they do watch.
