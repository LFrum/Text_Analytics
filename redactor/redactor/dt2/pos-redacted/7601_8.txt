**** ********* gets second chance at high school, on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter. In flashbacks, we see that the first time around was, to put it mildly, a major disaster. ***** Arquette is amusing in modest role as ****'s brother, who also enrolls to help out sis. Lots of subplots endanger but never overwhelm simple charm of movie. **** keeps making her niche as major innocent-sexy light comic actress.
