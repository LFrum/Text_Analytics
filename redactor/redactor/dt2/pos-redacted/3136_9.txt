This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, **** **** was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as *** ******* had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. ******* was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work. Years later he would win the coveted ******* ***** for his brilliant performance in "The Last Picture Show." **** Bond even outshines *** ******* in this movie. He is not the wagon master, that role is played by *******, but because of this movie he was later given the role of wagon master in the classic television series "***** *****." Ironically one of the bad guys in "***** ******," ***** ******, would star in the hit television series "Gunsmoke" on a rival network to "***** *****." **** Bond plays the leader of the Mormons heading west who often backslides to his sinning days by cussing only to be called down by fellow ****** **** ******* (Russell *******). When any bothersome situation arises ***** ***** (**** Bond) yells, "Blow your horn, ****** ********!" The Mormon sister, played to perfection by **** *******, then blows so hard and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. ******* and ******* were famous for playing Ma and ** **** in Ford's classic version of the **** ********* novel "The Grapes of Wrath."<br /><br />Another of the great character actors in Ford's company was **** ******, who plays one of ***** ****** *****'s notoriously mean but not too bright outlaw sons. ****** would become famous a few years later for playing Mose in Ford's "The Searchers." ****** lived to be 91. He was still making movies when he died.<br /><br />The wagon master ****** **** (*** *******) and his partner ***** (***** ***** Jr.) are horse traders who never take their job seriously, having a lot of fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. They get mixed up with a Mormon wagon train heading west. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the film. The main reason for the teaming is a redheaded Mormon beauty ******** ******* (Kathleen O'Malley) who catches *****'s eye. Along the way the train picks up a hoochie coochie show which includes a charlatan doctor (**** *******) and two soiled angels (****** *** and Ruth Clifford). Also joining up along the way is the Clegg family, wanted for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how arduous a journey west by wagon was in those days. <br /><br />The songs in the film were written by **** ***** of the legendary Sons of the Pioneers. *****' writing was almost as good as that of *** *****, who had previously done much of the writing for the group. *****' most famous song, not in this film, is the much recorded "Ghost Riders In The Sky." The Sons of the Pioneers do the background singing in "***** ******." This adds to the overall impact of wagons rolling west.<br /><br />It should also be noted that the acclaimed Native American athlete *** ****** from Oklahoma plays the role of a Navajo leader. This was his last film appearance. He died not long after "***** ******" was released.
