This really is a great film. Full of love and humor, it compels the audience to really care about the characters and participate in their journey. ******* Parness managed to assemble a great cast of top players, a minor miracle for a first film. No doubt, they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story. ***** Krumoltz carries the film with his understated intensity and honesty. ******* Lyonne is unpredictable, exasperating, and yet totally lovable as *****. Also a great turn by ***** ***** (great to see her on the screen again) as *****'s crazed but sympathetic mother. There is cutting wit throughout, allowing us the relief of laughter when faced with life's pain. The acting is impeccable, the editing tight, the direction inspired, and the music creates a fitting backdrop of mood. Given the present-day ********* *********** craze, full of big budgets, big names, car crashes and special effects, 'Max & *****' is a refreshing departure. Give yourself a treat and see this movie.
