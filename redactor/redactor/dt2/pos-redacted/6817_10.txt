I was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by ****** ******* before its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Festival. In twelve brief but exquisite minutes, ******* takes us on a life-changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society. The film embodies elegant direction, moving performances and a heart- rending story. ***** ****** and ***** **** radiate as the two lovers. And, in his first venture into dramatic narrative, ******* proves to be a director with a propitious future. I feel this short should be expanded into a feature film. It's difficult to describe talent, but as this debut film demonstrates, you know it when you see it!
