This film is a good start for novices that have never watched a 'Silent ****' and for those who believe that quality ****** started with their generations efforts. They are doing a disservice to themselves by not expanding their horizons. The 'Silent ****' is a art-form of acting in pantomime that is different from the sound film and the stage, it can stands on it's own merits.<br /><br />THE BELOVED ROGUE (1927) ****** ******* is a fictionalized history of the relationship of French Poet 'Francois ******' and 'King ***** **'. Through '******s' prodding 'King *****' will defeat his nemesis 'Duke of ********' minimize the Feudal System and establish the KING as head of the State and the beginnings of modern France.<br /><br />The cast is exceptional, lead by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, ****'s GrandFather). For those who only remember him for the decaying actor 'Larry *******' in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) or the ham in THE INVISABLE WOMEN (1940) this will be a revelation. Fit, trim with the 'Great Profile' still in evidence he commands the screen. Co-Starring in his first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with his 'cadaverous spider' interpretation of '***** **'. This is a duel of acting titans, each not giving the other a inch. On a trivia note is ********* ***** and ***** ****** ******** in his first film, his last, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other character actors who would continue in sound that are easily picked up on. <br /><br />****** ******* spared no expense in this handsome production supervised by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. Costumes, ***** and Sets are well done and not exaggerated like in a DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS productions. There is a touch of reality here. The copy on DVD that we watched from 'Delta Entertainment' came from a good master. Though not 'restored' its musical soundtrack was clear and the print only suffered from nuisance black-spots (dirt) and drop-outs. The only major damage at the end of the last reel from water. 'Kino' also has a edition which may be of a better quality since they do major restorations on their prints. Best check with them. In our opinion this is a 'must have' particularly if you have no 'silents' in your collection. This is a good place to start.
