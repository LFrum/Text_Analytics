This is my favourite *******. ****** ****** (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This ******* is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! ***** Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by ****** ****** (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially ***** ****** (very under-rated) and ******** ***** as the house keeper that ******* just keeps on upsetting. The surname of ****** ******'s characters in this is 'Paris'. That was the surname of ******* *****'s character in Mission Impossible. Coincidence? Or a ****** ****** joke?
