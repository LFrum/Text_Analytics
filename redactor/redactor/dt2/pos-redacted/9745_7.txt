***** ****** is, undoubtedly, the best of all American serials. In a date so early as 1936,********* was capable of making such an entertainment story, and twenty years later when I watched it for the first time as a kid it involved me in a great adventure and emotion. ****** ****** was the hero we always wanted to be in our childhood, and **** ****** the beautiful girl we always dreamt to be in love with. Dragons, octopus, monsters,gorillas were also the attraction. ******* ********* was a great presence as Ming, the Merciless. A true predecessor of ****** LucasÂ´s Starwars.
