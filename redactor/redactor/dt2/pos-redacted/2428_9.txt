I wouldn't be so sure to accept the DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against **** ********. First, read ***** *****'s book on which this film is based. **** ******** knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could possibly have known (forensic evidence in ****'s favor aside). Second, compare the pictures of Anastasia and **** ********. Anyone can see that they are one-and-the-same person. Third, visit ***** *****'s website (url below) where you can read detailed information about the DNA tests, as well as why ********* ************ and **** ******** are not the same person (scroll down to the link, "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA"). Even ************'s relatives believed that their sister and **** ******** were not the same person.<br /><br />I for one will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and **** ******** were indeed the same person; I will never be swayed to the contrary .<br /><br />www.peterkurth.com
