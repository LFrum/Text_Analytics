Viewed this GREAT Classic film of ***** ***** and thought her performance was excellent. However, the German film version which had English captions was her greatest performance. ***** ***** even mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite where she had to make the change from Silent films to sound. Greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films. This story was very sad because ***** *****(**** ********),"Ninotchka",'39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain. There were many scenes of Old NYC, the Brooklyn Bridge, ***** ****** and the sky line of Manhattan. ******* Bickford(**** *****),"Days of Wine & *****",'62 a Classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role.
