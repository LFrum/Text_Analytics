I watched **** ******** and the English Patient again this weekend. The former is a Civil War melodrama about ***** (**** ***), a Confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to *** ****** (****** ******) a girl he barely knows. Both films were lovingly directed by ******* ********* who does an exceptional job. Although, **** ******** is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy, backwoods dialog.<br /><br />Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient, had ******* ***** Thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart, alluring and beautiful ********* *******. The main problem with **** ******** is *** who seems silly and dim-witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that ***** could become obsessed after one kiss. As an actress ****** has a limited range, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. ****** was also too old to play the ing√©nue and ***'s love interest. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. For someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well-fed and over-dressed. ****** was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made-up for each scene. ******* Pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly. Even ******* ******* would have been an improvement.<br /><br />***** ********** was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for ******. **** *** was in his own silent movie in the Odysseus role, but played his part well. *** ******** was excellent as the London/Southern villain.<br /><br />During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables. However if you watch BBC adaptations of Dickens, ****** or Mrs. Gaskill everyone is articulate. Maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment.
