"********* *****", shown on cable recently, is a small movie that packs a lot. ****** Done directs with style. The screen play by Mr. Done and ***** **** makes a good thriller.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading.<br /><br />The film is the story about a young L.A. doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it. Upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten. Bad choice! What ****** **** finds in ********* ***** is hell in the desert. Right after landing a job as a bar tender, ****** meets a pretty young woman, *****, who, clearly is someone to stay away from. The young doctor is called to help as *****'s boyfriend *****, is gunned down by a drug dealer.<br /><br />We get to know *****'s family. His uncle **** appears to be OK, but his brother **** is a loose cannon. Every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile *****.<br /><br />The performances are fine. ******* ********* is ******, the man who should have gone to his L.A. practice instead of making a detour to the small town. ********* Holden is *****, a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings. ***** *********, ***** *****, ***** ****** play the men in the Mecklin family well. ******** Turturro makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer.<br /><br />The film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film.
