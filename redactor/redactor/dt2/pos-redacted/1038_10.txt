I posted on IMDb on this series recently, giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal release. I wrote to that address, mentioning *** ******** and his popularity prominently. I just received the following reply: <br /><br />From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: *********** Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /><br />Dear Kate, <br /><br />I work for the BBFC, the British equivalent to the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as films in this country. Anyway, I am currently in the process of giving a certificate to the 1980 miniseries '***********.' While researching the work on the IMDb, I noticed your post and thought you might like to know that the work is about to be released (hence the need for a certificate). <br /><br />I don't know which company is distributing it, but keep your eyes peeled! <br /><br />Kind regards, <br /><br />***** +++++++++++++++++ <br /><br />hooray! <br /><br />I also want to contact ******* re purchasing this. <br /><br />Kate ********* <br /><br />kk2840@earthlink.net I emailed the BBC recently regarding whether their terrific series *********** had ever been released on video or DVD. I have not been able to find it. I received the following reply. If you do write the BBC, be sure to mention that *** ********* is very popular in the US. You can also enter "*********** (1980)" on amazon.com, and find a box to check to request release by the owner (BBC) and be notified when it's released. <br /><br />Kate ********* kk2840@earthlink.net<br /><br />Here's the reply from the BBC:<br /><br />Dear Kate<br /><br />Thank you for your e-mail regarding '***********'.<br /><br />I was interested to read that you would like a copy of this programme which you have enjoyed. I have checked the BBC Shop and on-line retailers and can find no record of it being available. We are unaware of plans at present to release this programme on DVD. However, if you would like to make a suggestion, can I suggest you put it in writing to the commercial arm of the BBC:<br /><br />Commissioning Editor BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 **** **** ****** W12 0TT<br /><br />May I thank you again for taking the time to contact the BBC.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />****** ****** BBC Information ______________________________________<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br /><br />{Comments:} i am trying to find a copy of the terrific BBC production "***********', a six part series made in 1980 with *** ********* from a book/script by ***** ******.
