Caught this 1969 film on cable TCM one night. I remember when I first saw the film in Hong Kong, I really enjoyed the songs and performances by ***** ******* and ****** *****. I love ***** best in Francis Ford *******'s "Finian's *******" (1968) opposite **** *******, *** ******* and ***** ******. Simply ecstatic to learn that finally, this delightful Irish-flavored pot of gold musical is released on DVD! Ah, "it's that old devil moon (in your eyes)." <br /><br />***** ******* as *** ***** - yes, he did sing - quite a deliverance. He may not be a veteran at musical like *** ********, but he inhabited the role marvelously. The scene of him running across the lawn in his cape a-flying reminds me of the PBS series, "To Serve Them All My Days" - a lovable schoolmaster and loving man, he is, 'Mr. Chipey.' ***** and O'Toole somehow gave us just the right mix of spunk and circumstance. The songs and lyrics by ****** ******** are catchy as usual. The tunes of "You and I" and "Walk Through the World (with Me)" stayed with me the most all these years. And there's "What a Lot of Flowers," "And the *** Smiled," "Fill the World with ****" - not syrupy at all. Sometimes I think if the world is immersed in Bricusse's songs and words, we would overcome all strife on earth and 'lovely' will be all our days! Yes, "Talk to the Animals," too. ("****** *********" 1967) <br /><br />Musicals are a blessing to the world of moviegoers, they are somehow larger than life. Like the music and lyrics by the Sherman Brothers (******* * * and ****** *.) who gave us "****** ****** **** ****" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who wouldn't feel absolutely delighted simply uttering "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"? I was tickled by even just one featured song & dance number in the Spanish film "Km.0 - ********* ****" (2000). My all time favorite is French filmmaker ******* ****'s "***** ***** of Rochefort" (1967) with colorful cast of Catherine Deneuve and (late sister) ********* *******, ******* ******, ****** *******, ******** ********, **** ***** and ****** ******** singing, dancing to ****** *******'s music. Long live musicals.
