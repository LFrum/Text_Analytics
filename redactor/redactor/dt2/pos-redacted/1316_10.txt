"*******: A Life in Four Chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese author ***** *******, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of *******'s iconoclastic oeuvre. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. **** ******** makes you sympathize with ******* without having to deconstruct him or his work. It doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it. An added bonus: As we see *******'s fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society, ******** gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema. **** ******'s cinematography is spectacularly good. The grandiosity of composer ****** *****' work is perfectly suited for the project. "*******" is the best film I've seen this year, so far.
