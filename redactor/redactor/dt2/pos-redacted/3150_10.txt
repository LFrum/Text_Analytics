I saw the short titled "The Reader" recently and found that the movie was well planned and executed. I really felt for both characters that ****** ******* and ********* ***** portray in this film. ********* was able to show great range with her blind character and left me feeling emotionally connected. ****** was able to sell to me that she was totally committed in keeping "Sissy" or ***** protected from the grief of losing her sister who had been living in Copenhagen. The great thing about the film was in the short running time and budget of only ten thousand dollars, ****** ******* was able to make a very well made film that kept the interest of the viewer. Rodgers has a great insight into the actor's ability and transition great camera angles to showcase their talent. I always feel if a director can make a great film with a small budget then what can he or she do with a much larger one. Great job ******!!
