In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory ***** **** (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with ***** ******* and he does not know her. When ***** arrives in the island to get married with *****, he waits for her in the docks but ***** does not recognize ***** in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to *****. They get married and ***** shares his bank accounts with her. When *****'s sister writes a letter to ***** asking her sister to write to her, ***** discovers that the woman is not ***** that is missing. Further, he finds that the woman has cleared his bank accounts and left the island. ***** and *****'s sister hire an efficient private detective Comolli (****** *******) and ***** travels to France seeking the woman, but he has a nervous breakdown in Nice and is submitted to an intense sleeping therapy in a clinic. He recovers and finds that the woman, actually ****** ******* (********* *******), works in the Phoenix Club Privé in Antibes and lives in the low-budget ******** *****. ***** breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club, she tells that she was happy with him but her former dangerous lover ******* had blackmailed her. ***** is still in love with ****** and escapes with her to the countryside. But Comolli is chasing ****** in France accused of murdering *****.<br /><br />"La Sirène du Mississipi" is a film-noir by the great director/writer ******** ********, with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts. The femme fatale ********* ******* is astonishing, probably in the top of her beauty and is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence when he escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive. ********* ******* makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of *****. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Sereia do Mississipi" ("The Mississippi Mermaid")
