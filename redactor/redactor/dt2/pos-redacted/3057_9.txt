Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with ****** ********, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into ********'s magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer ***** ******, ***** **** is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including ***** ********* and ****** *****, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations. ****** Sanders gives a polished performance, whilst an eccentric millionairess (who turns out to be a rival racketeer) is admirably played by ***** *********. Also realizing the most from her role, ******** ***. The film was made, on locations in Spain, in 1949.
