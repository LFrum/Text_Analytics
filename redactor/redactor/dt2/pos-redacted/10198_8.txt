********* **** ****** (well played by ***** **********) gets blown up something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. He has his brain transplanted in the body of a nearly indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues who are led by wicked obsessive fellow scientist **** ***** (a perfectly hateful portrayal by ******* ***). ****** embarks on an all-out killing spree. It's up to nasty mercenary Hunter (a wonderfully loathsome turn by the divine *** *****) to put a stop to him. ******** Jean-Claude Lord, who previously helmed the under-appreciated slasher psycho thriller "Visiting Hours," stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable verve and maintains a zippy pace throughout, thus ensuring that this flick sizes up as an enjoyably trashy sci-fi/horror action outing. Paunchy character thesp ***** ******* easily cops top acting honors as disgusting fat creep Burt, who in the movie's single most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with ******'s pregnant wife Lauren (a winning performance by the lovely **** ******). **** *******'s nifty make-up f/x and **** ****'s thrilling score further add to the overall sleazy fun.
