Unlike **** and other detective movies, ****** *********'s hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage (and luck) would get out of it. ***** ***** is based on the same principle and so in a way it is ***** *****'s tribute to the master of suspense. The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes ***** ***** as a great director himself.<br /><br />It is the story of a common man ***** who one day realizes that he has a double called **** who in fact is a ***** *****. Suddenly ***** finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this **** who remains one step ahead of him. The suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme. Just like *********'s movies, ***** ***** can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkim.<br /><br />Everyone and I mean everyone; *** *****, ***** *****, ***** *****, ******** ****, Tanuja, SD Burman, ******* *****, ******* ********** etc. etc. are in their top forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
