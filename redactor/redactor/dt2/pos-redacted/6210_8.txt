The story of *** ****** opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend *****. ***** and his wife debate whether *** was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless scoundrel. The film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />*** was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a large railroad, dominating his board of directors and his competition, terrorizing his employees, slaughtering strikers. ***'s ambitious wife ***** was responsible for all of ***'s success. When he met her, he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a trackwalker for the railroad. ***** teaches him to read and takes over his trackwalker job while *** goes to school. He starts to rise one step at a time through the railroad hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president.<br /><br />But as *** becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to ***** gradually falls to pieces. His spoiled son despises him, and he takes up with a much younger woman (the aptly named Eve), with predictably catastrophic consequences. In his business life, *** is a total success; in his personal life, a disastrous failure. Much like the Hearst figure in "******* ****," *** symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system.<br /><br />Spencer Tracy is terrific in the role of *** ****** and the business scenes ring with authenticity. ******* ***** is also excellent as *****; both of them age beautifully in the multi-generational story. The film was written by ******* *******, but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which ******* became famous.
