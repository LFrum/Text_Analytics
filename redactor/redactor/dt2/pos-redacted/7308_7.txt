Norma had spent most of the 20s playing beautiful ingenues but her first talkie cast her as a brassy showgirl in "The Trial of **** *****" and she came through with flying colours. From then on her sweet and lovely ingenues were cast aside and she sizzled in parts that cast her as sophisticated women of the world or society girls out for thrills. "Let Us Be Gay" was made before but released after "The Divorcée" and was an unusual twist on the upper crust dramas that ******* made her own.<br /><br />Norma first appears without make-up as frumpish ***** *****, who's main purpose in life is to pander to her very unappreciative husband *** (Rod La Rocque). She is hurrying to get him off to his golf game - but in reality he is going to see his mistress. When *****, the mistress, comes to the house for a showdown, ***** faces the situation with civility but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions and *** leaves for good.<br /><br />Three years later Mrs. Courtland Brown (*****) comes to stay as a house guest of the eccentric Mrs. Bouccicoult ("Bouccy")(***** ********). ***** is now a knockout and "Bouccy" has a job for her. She wants ***** to romance a house guest, who in his turn is romancing her grand-daughter ***** (beautiful ***** ******). Shock!! Horror!! - the man is none other than ***, her ex husband!!! ***** carries off the meeting with sophistication and witty repartee - "there seems to be something strangely familiar about that man"!!! - and no one is the wiser.<br /><br />The film then settles down into one of those early very "talkie", boring "drawing room" comedies. ***** casts a spell over all the men and *** is desperate to start again. The women have all the strong roles in this film - men are just puppets. ******* ******* seems to be in the film as an extra butler - "pass me a cushion", "get me a drink", "move this chair" instead of *****'s harassed fiancé. Norma ******* is of course the whole show, ***** ******** adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric portrayals and ***** ****** is a real eyeful as the gorgeous *****.
