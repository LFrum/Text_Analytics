At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of ********, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.<br /><br />***** ******* is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty ***** type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V. cameraman. ***** deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of ***** *****, a producer looking for a killer hook for her `reality T.V.' cop show. She thinks that ***** will give her the `edgy' boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself. ***** **** *******, a patrolman-cum-actor who's watched way too many Police Story re-runs. Of course ***** and **** mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues.<br /><br />We know that ***** and **** are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie. That's the way buddy-cop movies are suppose to work. In fact, it has to be said that ******** rarely deviates from the time-honored clichés as writ by ****** ****** and ***** & ****. There's a high tech McGuffin to get the ball rolling (in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks.) There's a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin. There are chases, shootouts and explosions. We all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it's all going to turn out. You know what? There's nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know the well-worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip, not the destination. ******** doesn't strain to be original. Instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations. As a result, ******** does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy.<br /><br />****** ** **** is dryly funny as *****. In the past I've thought ** **** to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy. Lately, though, he's grown on me. He seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles. ***** ****** is hilarious as ****. The best way to describe his performance is that **** is what ****** would be if ****** weren't so talented and hadn't hit the big time. **** Russo has a droll time playing motor-mouthed show biz shark ***** *****. She stalks through the movie chasing high Nielson ratings with awe-inspiring determination. In her zeal she re-vamps *****'s life to make it more camera friendly. She even calls upon T. J. Hooker himself, ******* *******, to show ***** how be a more `authentic' cop. ******* is funny, playing himself precisely as we expect him to be, loud, oblivious and slightly obnoxious.<br /><br />I have to admit I was really looking forward to ******** and I wasn't disappointed. Ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit. Today it's doing moderate business at best. That's a pity because ******** is a whole lot of fun.
