First of all this was not a three hour movie - Two hours, ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! Perhaps, though, it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? Yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion. Overall, though, it was an interesting look into the lives of **** and Desi. I watch I **** **** from time to time and love it but never have I read or seen a biography, never knew anything about their lives off the screen. Because of this movie I do now but I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Everything here no one really needed to know. This was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. But it was made and the reason is because **** & Desi are still such huge stars and certain people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know ALL about our tv and movie stars. That is definitely so not true and very, very sad.<br /><br />Anyway, what was shown here in **** was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played *** ***** - not great casting at all. And the switch from ******** **** to ****** ****.... uhhh, like **** had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? That wasn't too great. But the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between **** & Desi. No, the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like I said, this focused mainly just on **** & Desi. Had there been more time, had the story been more about ****'s entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more. But they weren't so we got to see the likes of Gable & *******, *** ******* and ****** ****** very briefly instead. Wow, that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in ****'s life. Really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. Oh well. What was explored was done well, for the most part. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever watch this again and I don't think this movie'll be that memorable. For someone who digs I **** **** but isn't an enormous ******* **** fan, this should be an interesting watch. My grade for this: B
