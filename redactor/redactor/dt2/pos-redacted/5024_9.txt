An off beat but very delightful performance by **** ******** sets off this very funny comedy. His interpretation of the archangel is as a scuffy, womanizing, overweight, ladies man. And, he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to Chicago. **** Hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for Chicago Tabloid owner, *** *******. ***** MacDowell plays role much as she did her role in "Four Weddings and a Funeral." ******* ********* is neat in a cameo. Her comment, "******* doesn't suffer fools," is just one of many memorable moments. *** ******* is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect, a little to off the wall. Mainly you're there to see ******* take on a bull, mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant, and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul. It is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing.
