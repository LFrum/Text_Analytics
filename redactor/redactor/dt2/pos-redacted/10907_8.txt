This is truly a funny movie. His dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes I can recall. I thought the "I am gay" scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic, though it was funny. While watching it for the third time, I started to pick up on a little small segments that I had missed. One was when **** ******'s girl friend, a classic ditz, tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before. ***** ***** made this film successful along *** *******. This was also the first time I could appreciate ****** ********; she proved that she can be funny. She confirmed this in the TV series 'Will and *****.' One discovery that I found after the third viewing is ****** ******* of '6 Feet Under' fame. She sticks out with her red bangs, but it is obvious that this is one of her first films. *** Newhart is also very funny at the high school principle.
