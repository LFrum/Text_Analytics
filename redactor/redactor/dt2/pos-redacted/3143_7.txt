***** *****: The Case of the Fatal Fashion finds ***** and ***** ****** in New York getting an award from the American Bar Association. An undefeated trial record ought to get some recognition I would think. Anyway a friend of Della's, fashion editor ***** ******* gets herself arrested for the murder of a rival, ******* ****** and in fact ******* **** and ******* **** witness a confrontation between the two at a posh eatery.<br /><br />These two rivals have a thing going that makes ***** and ******* look like school girls. Of course ****** has a number of other people who loved her equally as much.<br /><br />The same perpetrator also ran down a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual. This throws ***** with his trusty investigative lawyer, ******* ***** in an alliance with some mobsters. Seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who wants also to mete out some justice in their usual manner. <br /><br />One thing I could not get is when ***** and mobster ****** ******** track down the perpetrator I cannot believe that the police were also not vigorously pursuing the case. Of course ******** has some access to sources that the cops just don't have.<br /><br />But the best part of this particular ***** entry is ***** **** as the young rather full of himself Assistant District Attorney introducing himself to ******* **** saying how he studied all of his cases and looked forward to beating him. Foolish Boy.<br /><br />In fact my favorite scene is **** and **** at a sidebar with the judge. **** was wanting to reopen his case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with precedents. **** catches him off guard and says he has no objection to the new witness and then proceeds to demolish the witness on cross examination. Absolutely priceless.<br /><br />***** **** is the best thing in this particular ***** ***** movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else.
