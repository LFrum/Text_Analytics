WESTERN UNION tells in melodramatic fashion the stringing of telegraph lines between two points out west. Siblings **** ****** and Virginia ******* work for Western Union, and ******** ***** and ****** ***** work for the Creightons. Indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop America's progress. This sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-rate musical score and vibrant color photography. Scott is a bank robber looking to mend his ways, and both he and engineer ***** vie for the attention of the perky *******. Lots of great character actors help keep the large production moving forward.
