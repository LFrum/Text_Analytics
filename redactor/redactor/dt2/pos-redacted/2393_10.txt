I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of ***** ****** and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented directing. I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by *****, (***** *****), ****, (Jessica Tsunis), and Morris, (***** ******). The supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. This film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom. Much like "The Outsiders" where *** ******, ****** *******, ******* ******, ***** *******, and others can be found. Look out *********, there are new stars out on the horizon and they can be discovered in a little Long Island, independent film called, "***** ******." Great job!
