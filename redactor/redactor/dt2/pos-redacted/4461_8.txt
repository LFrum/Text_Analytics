***** *****'s "Don't Torture a Duckling" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town ****** plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later *****'s gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;*****'s near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(******* *******)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite "House with the Windows That Laugh"(1976).
