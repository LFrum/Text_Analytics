Would you like to know why French and Italians love/hate each others? Would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime? So, go to watch *****'s film (in original language, of course) and you can look at a wonderful ****** ******** who finally speaks her native language from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, just at the border with Tuscany). And the rest of the characters speaking Livornese (lovely ******* ************ and all the others). ****** ******* definitely in his shoes with ********. A lot of fun, a real fresco of the Elba Island landscape, and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant (good for all times).
