I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of ***** *****'s story is a B film, the casting of ***, in her first top-billed role, is rather fascinating.<br /><br />Before *** became MGM's reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was ***'s follow-up film to EMMA, in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper (***** ********).<br /><br />***'s ***** is much nastier than ****** *******' version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP. ***'s ***** is very much a pre-Code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. It's the type of character that **** ****** or ***** *** could easily have played, but ***** here is still supposed to be of the genteel set. That's what makes her fallen character so tragic.<br /><br />In counterpoint to ***'s grasping ***** is the goody goody Amelia (******* ****) who is just not an interesting character. **** Forbes is icily good as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah: ****** ****** as Rawdon; ****** ***** as Osborne; ******* ******* as ******. Others are nearly Dickensian is their quirkiness: Billy ***** as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; ******* **** as the Marquis; ****** ***** as Polly the maid; ******* ******* as the housekeeper.<br /><br />*** is front and center throughout. While the ending is rather shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. The more ***'s ***** descends morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally "caught." Bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by *** in a film that should be seen.
