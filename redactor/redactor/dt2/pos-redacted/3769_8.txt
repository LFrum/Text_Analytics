Uproarious no-brainer comedy in which comedian **** ********** portrays ****** as an uptight doctor deeply committed to his research. Once he's snorted his experimental formula, he's turned into the scenery-devouring ****, causing no end of problems for everybody around him.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It has a truly insane, madcap approach; it's full steam ahead with one outrageously stupid yet undeniably hilarious joke after another. Funny lines and sight gags are in abundance; Blankfield plays each role for all it's worth. One highlight has **** bursting into song; "****'s Got Nothing to ****" is quite catchy and even now I can still hear it in my head. The climax even goes so far as to spoof old b & w horror films.<br /><br />The supporting cast is quite spirited as well, with Bess Armstrong as the ditzy fianc√©e ****, ****** ********* as the spunky ***, and *** ********* as flamboyant fellow doctor ***** ******. I do wish more could have been done with **********' character, as I'm a fan of the man, but it's always nice to see him in something.<br /><br />A large array of familiar faces parade before the camera: Cassandra "******" ********, ***** ******, *** ********, ****** *****, ******* ******, **** ****** ********, *** ** *****, *** *****, and ****** ******** in a cameo as himself.<br /><br />It goes without saying that if you prefer highbrow, intelligent comedy, you'd better avoid this one at all costs. But for those who enjoy a zany, politically incorrect, gleefully raunchy good time, this just might do the trick.<br /><br />One of the best bits is saved for last.<br /><br />8/10
