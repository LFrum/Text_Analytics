If you had a mother that described you like that, you just might be looking to bump her off yourself. It's how ***** ****** feels about **** ******, it's just how to put the plan in action.<br /><br />And his creative writing class taught by Professor ***** ******* gives him the idea. That and a viewing of ****** *********'s classic Strangers On A Train which gives DeVito the idea to switch murders with ******* who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who not only is cheating him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write, but is also carrying on with hunky **** Ciccone.<br /><br />***** ***** From The Train plays out kind of like Strangers On A Train as DeVito seems to have carried out his end of the murder scheme. But *******'s having a bit of a problem putting ****** down even with *****'s help. That woman might need killing, but she's going to take a lot of it.<br /><br />The only Academy recognition that ***** ***** From The Train got was an ******* ***** nomination for **** ****** for **** ********** *******. ****** lost to ******* ******* for **********, but the film turned out to be her finest hour. ****** already had the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year, but look at the list of credits she managed to amass even after ***** ***** From The Train, she worked right up to the end.<br /><br />I've seen interviews with both of the stars of ***** ***** From The Train, ***** ******* and ***** ******, and both have gladly conceded that **** ******'s performance as the mother from hell both made the film the success it was and stole it out from under them. Their acknowledgment of ******'s talent and performance is the best possible tribute.<br /><br />If ****** ***** in Strangers On A Train had been anything like **** ****** here, ****** ******* would gladly have joined ****** ****** in disposing of her. ***** ***** From A Train is one of the best black comedies out there, should not be missed.
