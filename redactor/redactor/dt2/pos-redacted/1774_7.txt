This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ **** ****** actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights. (To the extent she may have a double doing the action, it's hard to tell...but Peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it, and doing it well.) ++++ With a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent film. But it's basically cheesy. Still entertaining however. ++++ Not up to a regular ******* ******** film, but definitely above a regular **** ****** film. Color is typical of this '50s time period, ie. too garish and not realistic. The actors for Blackbeard and her first mate and the drunken doctor were good. ***** ****** was a bit weak. I don't think ***** ***** was right either. But certainly **** ****** and ***** ***** were probably the two best looking female stars in the '50s.
