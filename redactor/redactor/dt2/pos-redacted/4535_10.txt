**** Schnikey! This Movie rocks! The duo of ***** ****** and ***** ***** are great together. My Favorite parts are "*** *** in a little coat, Oh my gosh, Room service and more scenes that will be remembered for years to come. This movie has a huge cult following, I wonder why, which proves that even eleven years after ***** ******'s tragic death and he still is popular. He plays ***** which will make you laugh every time you still watch it. He is a great comedian and is missed. ** * spade reminds me of *** ******* while ***** ****** reminds me of **** *******. They done more than 2 movies together. This Movie is a must buy and should be in every Snl fan's collection.
