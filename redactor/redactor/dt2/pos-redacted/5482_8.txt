***** Horrigan (***** ********) is being harassed by ***** ***** (**** *********), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught. In the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer, "**** ******" (***** ****) from the Saw series. Through clever planning and influence, ***** is able to make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell).<br /><br />From thereafter, its a series of cat and mouse chase. ********* is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile. Once again showing a different role in this film, he astounds me with his ability to interchange his characters with the next film.<br /><br />I've watch ********* play in Con Air as a menacing insanely smart Cyrus, in Of Mice and Men as the tragically challenged bunny lover *****, to name a few. He plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking he can elude his captures.<br /><br />***** ******** is no one special me. He's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing he can really astound you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional.<br /><br />**** ***** plays ********'s love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role, to me, than ********'s.<br /><br />While this might seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation. You have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end. Along the way, you'll be mesmerized by ********* and ********'s chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.
