**** ******** and his brother ******* wrote *******, and in so doing, clearly drew parallels between the life of ***** ******* and his work. The film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action, and the fateful day when ******* held an army general hostage and spoke to the garrison, only to have it ridicule him and his Bushido ideals of the samurai code. ******* committed ritual seppuku on November 25, 1970, and he planned it as a meshing of beauty, art, and action. ******** edits scenes recreating that day with three different scenarios from *******'s novels: Temple of the Golden Pavilion, *****'s House, and ******* ******. The moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax via pulling back the camera while simultaneously zooming in. <br /><br />Black and white sequences are intermingled with the colorful moments depicted in *******'s novels. The black and white scenes represent memories from *******'s childhood and youth. ******** correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from the novels that often parallel *******'s real life, such as his stammer, development of his bodybuilding obsession, and his fostering of the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art, and action is exemplified in the chosen depictions from the respective novels. The color sequences are reminiscent of early, stagy Technicolor films, giving the film, perhaps, an intended surreal quality considering the subject matter.<br /><br />*** ***** plays the real ******* with unfailing determination, headed to the general's office on that fateful day and resembles the real *******. ******** took tremendous risks with this film in focusing on the novels he did and with tying them thematically to both *******'s personal life and his literary ambitions. The editing of the film between the three main sections of November 25, 1970, the black and white growing up segments, and the colorful novel scenes clearly point to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art, and action in *******'s life. At times, it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer. *** of 4 stars.
