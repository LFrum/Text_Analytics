Dutiful wife ***** ******* (as ********* "Kitty" Brown) waits on husband *** ** ****** (as *** *****) hand and foot. While making him breakfast in bed, and helping him dress for a Sunday golf outing, Ms. ******* suggests joining *** ** ****** for the day, noting how infrequently the two see each other. But, ** ****** puts her off, saying her presence adversely affects his game. Then, unexpectedly, ******* meets the real reason for her husband's frequent absences his pretty blonde mistress!<br /><br />Three years later, ******* is a glamorous and flirty divorcée. While summering in Paris, she has struck up a friendship with wealthy, older socialite ***** ******** (as as Mrs. "******" ******cault). Ms. ******** invites ******* to her Long Island home, to socialize with some friends, and ask a favor. ******** is worried about her granddaughter's relationship with a suave, worldly man. She wants young ***** ****** (as Dionne) to marry ******* ******* (as *****), instead. Aware of *******'s flirtatious conquests, ******** asks her to lure the undesirable man away from Ms. Eilers. ******* is stunned to discover the man is ** ******, her ex-husband.<br /><br />******* and ******** make this a cute, entertaining play. They are in top form, giving guaranteed-to-be-popular performances, with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is silly and predictable; yet, in a way which helps the humorous situation. And, the ending is quite clever. In fact, the comic "Let Us be Gay" may have aged better than *******'s larger-produced, and more serious, "The Divorcée", which was released around the same time. The cast uniformly fine. ** ****** is better than his film with ****** ****; but, his role is not at all endearing. ******* Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) are funny supporting suitors.<br /><br />Those not familiar with ***** ******* may not realize it is she who appears as the dowdy wife in the opening scenes. This is ******* as "Kitty" before her make-over. Watch the close-ups of ******* with light, natural make-up, for a good look at an intriguingly beautiful woman.<br /><br />******* Let Us Be Gay (1930) ****** ** ******* ~ ***** *******, ***** ********, *** ** ******
