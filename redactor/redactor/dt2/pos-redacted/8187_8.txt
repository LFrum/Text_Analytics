I enjoyed the film very much, especially the performance of the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as the concubine.<br /><br />It was a little distracting, however, to have Chinese dialogue PLUS English subtitles PLUS American-accented voice-over, even though the voice over was very well synchronised.<br /><br />*** shi huiang di's (The First Emperor of ***'s)family name was *****, and his given name ***** so in the English he should have been referred to as "King *****" or "******* *****", and NOT as "King Ying *****" as in those days the two family/given names were not used together.<br /><br />The State of *** is pronounced "Chin" not "shin" - a pity the researchers didn't get this right.<br /><br />I forgave this but was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he was buried at "Zai-an" together with his terra cotta warriors. The town Xi'an is pronounced "See-an" , never "Zai-an"- surely the American voice-over speakers could have got that right !
