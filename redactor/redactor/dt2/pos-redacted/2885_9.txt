******* **** *******'s adaptation of "Picture of Dorian Gray" is a fine tribute to ***** *****'s talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between ***** and ***** showing that time has passed.)The acting however is brilliant. Sir john ******* return's to his ***** roots as lord *****,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that ***** brought to life so meticulously in his novella. ****** ***** is also strong,offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist ***** Hallward.Peter Firth,while not originally my vision of Dorian, handles the role with style and grace...and later with a convincing strain of cruelty. The supporting cast is equally fine, *******'s former 'Importance Of Being *******" co-star **** Francon-Davies plays his philanthropic **** ****** with dignity and **** ****** makes a touching ***** ****. The wit,pathos and tension of *****'s work have been remarkably transferred to the screen. My only other qualm is with the hair styles. Many of them seemed out of place,looking more like 1970's versions of Victorian hairdos rather than the actual style. Overall however,the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence.
