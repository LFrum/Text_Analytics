In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. ***** ******** is plagued by **** ********* in this riveting film. ********* says he's going to kill the president, and he purposely calls ********, and pushes his buttons. He questions ********'s ability to protect someone. ********* brings a cold, but very intelligent mindset to his character. Everything he does, he does for a reason, and he's not shy about killing. ******** has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch *********, but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. ******** ******** ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn.
