Many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message, thus confusing the hero, not to mention the audience...<br /><br />Dr. *** McKenna (***** *******) and his wife Jo, a former musical star (***** Day) are vacationing in Morocco with their son, Hank (*********** *****), when they meet ** * and Mrs. *******, a British couple (Brenda de ****** and ******* *****). They are also befriended by a charming *********, ***** ******* (****** *****), who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute...<br /><br />The MacKennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the *******s, when they spot ***** *******... <br /><br />The next day in the market place, they are caught in an assassination intrigue... While they are wandering in the local market, the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an **** fleeing from his pursuers... Dr. McKenna stands amazed as the **** falls into his arms, a knife sticking out of his back... <br /><br />Gulping his last breath, the dying man mutters some words and collapses... Dr. McKenna is completely taken aback when the ****'s hood falls from his head and he is revealed as ******* in disguise... McKenna is left knowing too little, but as far as the assassins are concerned, too much...<br /><br />To prevent Dr. McKenna from revealing what he knows, the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage... The film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnappinghow to get the little boy back safely... The subplot about the assassination is just the setup...<br /><br />The film is a breathless escapade... The death of ******* comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it... <br /><br />******* is charged with emotion as the Midwestern doctor, accidentally involved in political intrigue... His perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly humana person we could easily identify with... It is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film... <br /><br />By 1956, the lovely ***** Day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer... She had been particularly strong opposite ***** ****** in the Ruth Etting's biopic, 'Love Me or ***** **,' but she was still unsure of her basic Thespian talents...<br /><br />The casting of character actor ****** ****** as the assassin, is brilliant... The man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil...
