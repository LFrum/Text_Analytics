A year after the release of the average "House of Frankenstein", ********* released another Monster Mash where all their famous character would collide once again. "House of *******" would reunite *******, the Frankenstein's creature and the Wolf Man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio. Directed once again by **** ** ******, "House of *******" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed (although still flawed) story that while far from perfect, is a more appropriate closure than the previous film.<br /><br />The story ignores most of the events of the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to the story. ***** ******* (**** *********), tired of having to hide during sunlight, asks help to the brilliant scientist, Dr. ******* (****** *******), a physician famous for his research in biology. ******* becomes fascinated by *******, and soon begins an experimental treatment, in the mean time, ***** ****** (Lon ****** Jr.), the Wolf Man, visits ******* with the purpose of get rid of his curse. Soon ******* realizes that ******* is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to *******'s blood is also developing a disease in him. The discovery of the Frankenstein's monster (***** *******) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist.<br /><br />After the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight-forward Gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries. The story (by ****** ** **** Jr.), has many interesting themes, as the contrast between ******* and Talbot (both looking for a cure, but with different purposes) and *******'s increasing madness. Probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a gorgeous but deformed woman who aids Dr. ******* hoping to be cured of her condition.<br /><br />Director **** ** ****** is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. Despite the low-budget, ****** crafts a Gothic horror that while simple, is quite effective, and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way. While it's never on the level of the originals, "House of *******" recovers that charm that ********* ******* horror films used to have, and ****** makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine.<br /><br />The cast is very good this time, with *********, ****** and ******* reprising their roles (although *******'s role is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. The addition of ****** *******, **** ***** and ****** O'Driscoll to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series, with ******* giving a terrific performance as Dr. *******. A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of ******* ****** as the creepy ********* complete one of the better cast ********* horror films has had in years.<br /><br />"House of *******" is a nice addition to the series, specially after the mediocre "House of Frankenstein". It's nice to see ****** back in form in a somewhat serious horror film, however, and while the plot is quite original, it suffers not only because of the budget, but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results. It's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines, but the film dedicates very few time for each of them to develop, and the film seems very rushed and disjointed.<br /><br />While far from perfect, it's also far from being the worst of the series. "House of *******" is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters. Later the monsters would be back in "*** ****** & *** ******** **** ************" (1948), but that would be a whole different context. after the disappointing previous entries, it's easy to dismiss "House of *******", but give it a chance, and let the monster roam for a last time. 7/10
