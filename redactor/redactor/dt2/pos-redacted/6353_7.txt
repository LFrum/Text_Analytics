Hummmm,...ANOTHER Keystone comedy set in the park!!! It seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park, as so many of *******'s and ********'s films are set there! And, while this is yet another one, it is different enough and well made that I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />***** is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting ***** *******. I think she's supposed to be a little younger, though in her mother's eyes she is TOO YOUNG to be interested in men. Well, ***** does not share her feelings and soon he and ***** run away for some innocent fun. Things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. ***** finds it and gives it to ***** as a gift,...and MANY problems result.<br /><br />Decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film.
