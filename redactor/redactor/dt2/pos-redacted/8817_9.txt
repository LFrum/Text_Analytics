This blaxploitation classic about a kung fu mama who travels to Hong Kong to avenge her brother's death offers everything you learned to expect from the genre. Playmate ******* **** (with a giant afro) really kicks ass and usually loses her clothes very quickly. If you don't take it all too seriously, the movie is great fun to watch. **** Shaw gives a solid performance, ******* **** is a little less convincing. *** Grier she ain't.<br /><br />This is where ******* ********* got his idea for the light switch scene in "****** *****" from.<br /><br />The soundtrack by *** ****** is a gem and is frequently used in rap songs.
