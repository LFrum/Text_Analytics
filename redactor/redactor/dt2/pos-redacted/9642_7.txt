I recommend that movie viewers if in the New York City area go to the Intrepid museum and get some idea of how closed in and cramped the living was for the crews of World War II vintage submarines. How much more so that must have been for the seamen during World War I. It must have truly been hell below.<br /><br />Walter ****** and ****** ********** head the cast of Hell Below, ****** as the by the book captain and Montgomery as his free wheeling number two. They're both quite believable as Naval officers and the rest of the cast like ****** *****, ****** *******, ***** *******, ***** *****, ******** ********, etc. fill their roles quite nicely.<br /><br />The silent service got more popular during World War II and after. It's amazing, but I could name a whole slew of submarine pictures like ******* ***, ********* *******, Hellcats of the Navy, *** ******, *** **** and many more and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them. I guess there truly is a limit on situations as well.<br /><br />***** *******'s performance is interesting. He's pretty funny and his scene with the boxing kangaroo while on shore leave is very funny indeed. But I'd have to say a character like him in those cramped quarters is probably very necessary for morale. If you don't have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine, you ought to get one transferred to your ship immediately.<br /><br />The highlight for me however is ******** ********'s death scene. Very similar to **** *******'s in Island in the Sky. It will haunt you long after you've seen this film.
