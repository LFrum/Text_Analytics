********* ****** is a series of superb sequences of cinematic opera that pass from pastoral to lamentation and end in a triumphal cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince ********* ****** (******* *********) defeats the Teutonic Knights in a battle on the ice of **** ******.<br /><br />The film is a splendid historical pageant which shows director ****** ********** at his most inventively pictorial, and climaxes in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of **** ******, including ****** ******* (1965), Mulan (1998), and King Arthur (2004). ********* ****** was kept out of circulation due to changing political winds, and then enshrined as perhaps the most influential Soviet-made historical film.
