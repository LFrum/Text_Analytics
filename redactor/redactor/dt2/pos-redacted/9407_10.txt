I thought this movie was excellent. *** ****** is one of my top favorite actors, he was perfect as ******* ******. I found everything about it to be great, acting, costumes, production, directing, photography, script and music, etc.<br /><br />Spoilers Coming Up! You Have Been Warned!<br /><br />****** ******, who they had tell the story in the movie was bludgeoned to death by her violent troubled neighbor ******* ******. ******* did this out of jealousy of his brother ***** when ****** rejected him and took ***** instead. Thankfully though, they caught him years later and he was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. Although, I think he should have been sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of parole.<br /><br />Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs way up.
