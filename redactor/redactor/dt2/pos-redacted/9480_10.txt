The first time I've seen this DVD, I was not only happy because of the fact that it was the first time in decades that the band put out anything, but also because the DVD itself is extremely loud. ***** Page obviously can't live with quiet music, I guess. I do must say though that during the concert at Royal ****** ****, they expanded 'How many more times' and 'Moby ****' too long. Other than that, it was exquisit. My favorite song of all time is now on that DVD. Trampled *********. It's either that one or 'In my time of dying'. In that song, ***** really plays that thing good. Ever seen ***** ****** play? Well, ***** plays just like him, except his guitar is lower.
