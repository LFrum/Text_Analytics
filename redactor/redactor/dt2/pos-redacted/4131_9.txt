**** Busey is superb in this musical biography. Great singing and excellent soundtrack. The ***** ***** Story is a much better movie than ** *****. From reading other comments, there may be some historical inaccuracies. Regardless, it is a fun toe-tapping film, and a good introduction to ***** *****'s music.
