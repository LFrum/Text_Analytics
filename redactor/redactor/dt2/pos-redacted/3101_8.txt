The Further Adventures of Ma and ** ****** almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. ******* *********, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and ** ******. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating ****** ***** for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I. The prize money from the quilt contest was to be used to send *** ****** to college. In this movie *** is returning home as a college graduate.<br /><br />There are two plots intertwined in this movie. One is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving into a state of the art modern house. The other is a light morality play on how environment affects children as they grow up.<br /><br />** ****** (***** ********) wanted a free tobacco pouch for entering a contest, and ended up winning a house. His disappointment at not getting the free tobacco pouch is played for laughs quite a bit. When ** plays with dynamite he is totally oblivious to the explosion. ******** never flinched in the scene as the debris from the explosion fell around him. He played the part to perfection. In his autobiography, **** ***** mentioned how impressed he was with ***** ********'s deadpan delivery. ******** took that comedic device to a high level of perfection.<br /><br />Ma (******** ****) and ** move into the new house with modern conveniences that confuse Ma and ** almost as much as they help them. Ma adapts far more quickly than **. Included with the modern conveniences is a television, a very new household item in 1949. Moving walls, hidden beds, and plumbing fixtures are used as comic props, but the attention is on Ma and **, never the props themselves.<br /><br />*** ****** (******* ****) meets *** ****** (Meg Randall), a magazine writer who feels that hygiene and environment are essential for children to realize success as adults. *** is a bright, self-made man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. This subject is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes, but left to subside. It was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie.<br /><br />Seeing the Kettles moving out of their run-down old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the characters staying true to themselves. Ma was the practical one, just as she had been in the The Egg and I. ** was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him.
