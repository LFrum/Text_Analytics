Very good "Precoder" starring **** ***********, which in a way, kind of reminded me of *****' "Only Angels Have Wings" (1939), in which *********** also acted. This film was directed by masterful ******* *******, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture "Wings".<br /><br />*********** plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty ***** ******, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant *** ******; but when ***********' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues.<br /><br />"Central Airport" has many thrilling moments and some moving and touching scenes too, thanks to the great chemistry that develops between *********** and Eilers (who, in my opinion, in this film resembles very much actress ******* ********). *** ***** is good as *********** brother, fresh from his success in Wyler's "*** ***** of Culver".<br /><br />Great special effects, good flying stunts, swiftly paced film; in all, highly entertaining. Don't miss it when TCM airs it again.
