"Plots With A View" of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the British could do it. The film's sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick-ish. It's the only film by director **** ****** I've seen so far, and while I am not intending to watch any of his other films at the moment (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this one is highly enjoyable and very funny. The film takes place in a little town in Wales, where ***** ********** (****** Blethyn) is married to the town's drunken and adulterous major (****** ****). The local mortician ***** (****** ******) has been desperately in love with ***** since their childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love to her. Apart from being desperately in love, ***** has some other problems, as the eccentric American mortician ***** ********** (*********** ******) has opened a funeral flourishing business in the same town... The film's odd, very British wit should amuse everybody with a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre. Also, "Plots With A View" profits from a wonderful cast. ****** Bethlyn, who has already proved herself to be a funny lady in 2000's "Saving *****", plays the lead, and she is once again very funny, and very lovable in her role. ****** ******, who plays her shy admirer, delivers a great performance as always, and ****** **** fits perfectly in the role of *****'s sleazy husband. ********* ***** ***** is also great as the husband's 'secretary', I'm becoming a bigger fan with every film I see her in. The greatest role, however, is played by the incomparable *********** ****** (one of my favorite actors). Walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric Mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox. Overall, "Plots With A View" is a vastly entertaining little British Comedy that I highly recommend!
