After a group of young friends experience car trouble whilst travelling off the beaten track, they accept an offer of help from lonely local *** ******* (***** *******), owner of a nearby museum full of historical wax mannequins. Once at the creepy roadside attraction, the friends are stalked by a mask-wearing lunatic who can bring the museum's dummies to life through the power of the mind.<br /><br />******* ****'s bad guy is a demented cross between The Texas Chain Saw ********'s Leatherface and *******, the scary kid from the classic Twilight Zone episode 'It's a Good Life', whilst the plot is a blend of elements from the aforementioned TCM, *********'s ******, and House of Wax. The atmosphere and execution of ******* ****, however, is so totally off-kilter that, in this respect, it's virtually impossible to draw comparison with other earlier movies.<br /><br />Director ***** **********'s continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality, and with a brilliant left-field performance from Connors, an impossibly creepy score from **** ********, a collection of truly unsettling mannequins with detachable jaws, and the presence of super sexy ***** *******, who spends the film in (and briefly out of) tiny denim hot-pants and a figure hugging boob-tube, ******* **** is a totally unforgettable and ultimately one-of-a-kind horror experience well deserving of its cult following.
