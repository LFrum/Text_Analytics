Watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching **** **** for the first time.<br /><br />This series has it all. The kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the TV to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admiration.<br /><br />In short, we start out with **** *********, an astronaut, who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black, ironically known as Peacekeepers.<br /><br />Other colorful characters consists of D'argo, big dude with a short temper and a sword/laser-rifle. ***** Sun, former peacekeeper and a Ph.D in buttkicking. ***** Zhan, who's a plant. No really, she is. She's also a priest, but with a mean streak. There's also ******* ***** ***, an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good.<br /><br />Later in the series we meet the most sexy alien that has ever been on television, namely Chiana. A young and seemingly chronically horny Nebari. She is played by **** ******, which is a name you should remember.<br /><br />One of the many things I love about these series is that since **** ********* ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he keeps giving references to "Real Life". Namely, when **** is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaint is that when he returns, ***** The Vampire Slayer will be dead.<br /><br />So Frell all the other series, get your Dren together and spend an Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you, Sci/Fi as you know it, will change forever.<br /><br />This series has it all. It's sexy. It's actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's ********
