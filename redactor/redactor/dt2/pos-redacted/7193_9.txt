A great combination: - ******'s humor - Uderzo/Goscinny world and characters - limited presence of ********* *******<br /><br />The original Comics was great - one of the better of an overall great series - and ***** ******, one of the funniest member of the famous French group *** ****, was able to film, replicate and supplement, the great work done by goscinny and uderzo by cleverly enforcing the story, giving to ****** ******* his best role (at last a little bit far from his usual repeatable part), gathering a bunch of great actors (Gerard darmon is wonderful, as often, ****** himself is a great Cesar).<br /><br />In addition, while being obligated to keep on with ********* ******* as *******, ****** cleverly tuned down his role in the movie to give prominence to ****** and *******... which is always a good idea!<br /><br />=> Great environment, great scenario, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra... This movie would have deserved a 10 if ******* hadn't been involved.
