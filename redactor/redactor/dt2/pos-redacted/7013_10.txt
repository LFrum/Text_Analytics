Like for most women this movie is the ultimate chick-flick. With it's hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, i mean timeless classic like (I've Had) The Time of My Life & the wonderful She's Like The Wind makes this movie. I adore ******* ****** in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it's so hot. He sings "She's Like The Wind" in the movie. The chemistry between ****** and co-star Jennifer Grey is amazing. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. But saying this ***** ******* 2: - ****** ****** is also great but ******* ****** scenes makes this. I love the songs, dancing and everything about it but it isn't ***** *******. Like I said it's an amazing chick flick. Please let there be a 3rd because I love to see what happens with *******'s character ******. Jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey ******* makes up for that if you know what I mean!!! Great movie and I'm so pleased ***** **** didn't win the movie role. I heard whispers he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn't dance.
