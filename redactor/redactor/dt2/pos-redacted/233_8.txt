I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored of Ms. ********'s looks, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. ********. She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of '*****', where she is sex symbol par excellence).<br /><br />**** is more than ably assisted by **** ***** and **** *******. The comedy may be dated, but it is still quite amusing. Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window.<br /><br />But **** drives this whole movie. An excellent cast, featuring **** ****** and the always- wonderful, wise-cracking Eve ***** doesn't hurt.<br /><br />**** sings, **** dances, all the while looking impossibly beautiful! The music may be short of classic, but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite clever.<br /><br />I find this movie works better than '*****', which I regard as a flawed film. To Ms. ********'s credit, she also drives '*****', and ***** drives any red-blooded male insane.<br /><br />The film holds up well after all these years. Much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus!
