A hilarious comedy by the best director ever, ** *****. The list of eighties TV icons goes on and on. Milano (Who's The Boss), Yothers (Family Ties), Stone (*** *********), Robinson (***** *****), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand!!!). It is one of the funniest movies ever. Great lines, meaningless subplots, cheesy, bad acting. It is about a group of high school kids who need to pass drivers' ed. Mac from ***** ***** needs them to pass their final exam, or he'll be fired. Great performance by ***** ***** as the jerk/kinda cool guy **** ******, but is nothing compared to B.D. Wong's Kiki (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages, so bad it's good.
