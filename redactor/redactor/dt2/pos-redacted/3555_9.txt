Having reviewed 3 of the 4 ***** and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. **** Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You **** M'Lord. I don't regard ** ** ** as a classic, but it is still funny.<br /><br />It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by ******* ***********, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff include fun entertainment manager ***, his sidekick Spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat ******, careless maid ***** who longed to be a yellow coat and the Punch and Judy man Mr Partridge who hates kids. Situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).<br /><br />Not a classic, but still funny. ******* *********** left half way through, so this, a bit like **** ***** and ******, outstayed its welcome. ***** ***** was actually a red coat at Butlins.<br /><br />Best Episode: *****'s Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.
