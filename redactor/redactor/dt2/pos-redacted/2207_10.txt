Dark and bleak sets, thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife (or razor) a perfect cast lead by Broadway greats ***** and Lansbury. This is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and **** is his Masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the darkly humorous Act I finale- "A Little Priest" where ****** and **** fantasize about the victims that will wind up in their meat pies , this play never ceases to thrill,excite and satisfy. ***** ****** also excels as *******, even she, as the plays ingenue seems slightly mad.Edmund ******* turns in a bravado performance as the corrupt Judge who lusts after ****** and is the subject of ****'s vendetta. Lansbury and ***** command the show as only two great actor/stars can do. Other musical highlights include ****'s "johanna" ******'s "worst pies in London" and the Act II opening 'GOD THATS GOOD", And that is a title to describe this production !
