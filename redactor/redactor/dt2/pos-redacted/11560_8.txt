****** ****** gives a typically top-rate performance in one of his first-ever lead roles as brash, ambitious, uncompromising young staff producer ******* **********, a real talented hot shot with a discerning "golden ear" and the son of a famous jazz pianist to boot. *******'s eager to cut some tracks with the smokin' R&B outfit the Group (none other than *****, **** & Fire in their awesomely funky prime), but his rigidly commercial greedhead label A-Chord Records run by uptight, mob-connected middle-of-the-road square ***** (a properly unhip Ed Nelson) wants him to record a hit single for the hideously insipid Carpenters-like pop pap trio the Pages, an allegedly squeaky clean bunch which includes smarmy pedophile step-dad Franklin (a perfectly vile **** *****), bitchy, neurotic daughter Velour (a fine, flighty turn by perky, comely brunette ******* ********), and hedonistic smack addict son Gary (former 50's juvenile sitcom staple ***** ****). The extremely naive and idealistic ******* must learn pronto how the music business truly works and play the lowdown dirty game as best he can or else he'll lose both the Group and his credibility.<br /><br />Adopting an acrid, incisive, corrosively harsh and unsparingly biased script from syndicated columnist and rock journalist ****** *******, director *** ***** (who's most famous for producing "Superfly") shows a decidedly cynical and unflattering depiction of the various bribes, pay-offs, broken promises, back-stabbings, duplicities and double-dealings which are an unpleasant, yet intrinsic part of the largely corrupt rock music business, with particularly thoughtful thematic asides concerning *** vs. Commerce, fighting to retain one's artistic integrity, and the then recent push to homogenize rock into bland, useless, creatively stagnant mainstream respectability. Moreover, this gritty, downbeat gem offers a rare fascinating, minutely detailed and wholly believable backstage glimpse at the recording process as recording booth console cowboy ******* struggles gamely in his own words to "make chicken salad out of chicken s**t." Appearing in nifty bits are disc jockey and legendary "fifth Beatle" Murray the K as leering, lecherous DJ Big **** ****** (Velour bites his hand after Big **** paws her thigh during a live on-air interview!), New York soul DJ and host of NBC's "Friday Night Videos" ******* ******* as his own jazzy'n'jivin' self, R&B singer-songwriter ***** **** (she penned the lovely "Just One Look") as a church pianist, and tubby, bald-pated 70's blaxploitation favorite ******* ********* as a priest at a wedding. The rather poor sound and ***** *******'s sloppy cinematography inadvertently add to the film's overall ragged, rough-around-the-edges documentary-style authenticity. Although technically a bit lacking, this movie overall still rates as one of the great, most bitterly pessimistic unsung behind-the-scenes rocksploitation gems from the 70's.
