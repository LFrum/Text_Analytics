Yes, I am sentimental, and yes, I love movies where kids are the better humans. True, Klatretøsen does have some logical or even plot shortcomings. These are more than compensated by the kids' great acting (****** first movie role at all!) and the charm of a Dogma film (I liked this kind of cinematografic art long before the Dogma; ever since ******'s 'Herz aus ****'). Well, I cried through the last fifteen minutes which is a higher tear factor than bambi or Fly away home had for me.
