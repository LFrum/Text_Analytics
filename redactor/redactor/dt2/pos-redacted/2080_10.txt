I've seen various ******s, and I've taught the play. As I watch ******, I'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as ****** himself, so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit. He deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding ******'s character. He illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light into this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we cringe at the horror ****** feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because ****** feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else. And we shudder at ******'s own betrayals, because ****** is not afraid of the baseness to which ****** can descend. In short, ****** gives us ****** in full, and ****** in full is the greatest character in literature. That's why I'm satisfied that ******'s ****** is the finest performance I've seen by an actor.
