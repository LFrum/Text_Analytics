It's wartime drama - WWII, with French and Jews and Germans, but this one is somehow fun, earnestly so. ******** ********* ********* co-wrote the script to his well-received film "*** ******" (2003). Unlike director ******** *********'s "Safe Conduct" aka "Laissez-passer" (2002), w-d Rolf Schubel's "****** Sunday" (1999), or w-d ****** *****'s "***** ******" (1997), "*** ******" is as chipper as its title sounds - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have the beautiful talented ******** ****** to thank for. It is her delightful performance throughout as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of it all, that made the film so enjoyable as it is. Hell, what's another derailment of her plan and expectations - will worry about that another time. The backbone of the story does revolve around a pair of young enthusiasts: ******* ********* as Frédéric and ******** ******* (from Francois Ozon's "8 Women") as Camille. The incomparable ****** *********, the witty **** ***** (of "My Wife is An Actress") and versatile ***** ****** (juggling French, English and German here) are some of the stellar cast involved. <br /><br />There are many characters coming and going in this plot of a movie, and how it's all juggled is a skilful knack that requires no analysis - ********* is simply a genius. The story just builds upon itself, one episode after another, or even with overlapping events, but never confusing - that's the delight of it all, somehow every detail turns out right on the screen and we just lap it all up like a tastily presented French dessert, literally so. There's thrills, trills, tender hesitant moments and taut ominous escapes, all playing out in front of our eyes. <br /><br /> From reading the ********'s Note on the Sony Pictures Classics' *** ****** official site, ********* indicated this is his most personal and successful work ever. Depicting Bordeaux 1940 from memories of his childhood years is very much close to his heart and he "had worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years." This film is a labor of love all round, the cast and crew complementing the director's passion and a formidable script by collaborative writers along with the director and his son ****** - adaptation efforts by ****** ********, ******* *******, and ****** Tonnerre.<br /><br />Music by ******* ***** (varied in tone from his previous film scores like "The English Patient" or "Talented *** ******"), who provided a befitting theme that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot going - almost like a train going non-stop, reflecting ******'s *******'s vivacious energy (even when she's tired), keeping her going as she meets whatever comes, walking on with head held high and stylish attire always, no looking back, let alone time for regrets. <br /><br />Ah, mustn't forget the wonderfully translated, skilful subtitles by *** ******, who also did subtitles for films in Italian: "Bread and ******" (2000) aka **** e tulipani, "The Last Kiss" (2001) aka L'ultimo bacio, and *** ******'s "Heaven" (2002).<br /><br />If you find this much too light a wartime relationship drama, try w-d Mäx *********'s "***** and ******" (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances from ******* ****** as ***** and ***** ******** as ******.
