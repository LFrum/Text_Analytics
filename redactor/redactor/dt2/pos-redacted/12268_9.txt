This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialog is crisp, the pace is fast. Not only is this a clever comedy, this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business.<br /><br />There are so many funny lines...a couple of my favorites:<br /><br />***** ********: (sarcastically) It must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room. ****: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's awful!!<br /><br />*****: He must be good looking ****: How do you know that? *****: No one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!<br /><br />The performances of ***** ******, ****** ******, and ******* **** were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny **** ******! I love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this film.
