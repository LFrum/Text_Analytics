A good, but not great film, "The Great Dictator" is *******'s first talkie. It's a good effort, and at times a remarkable satire on ******, but unfortunately the moments of ******* brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, *******, the silent screen master, just uses too many words in this film, and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films, such as (better) "Limelight". Still, ******* was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable. ******** ******* doesn't have the glow she did in "****** *****" (her off-screen affair with ******* was cooling at the time), but she is always worth seeing, and **** ***** just about steals the show as a rival dictator to *******'s famous creation ******.
