It's also the best book I've ever read. **** Urban and ***** **** are great together. It had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when *** is talking. I wish *** would have smacked ***** like he did ****. ***** just lead *** on all those years with no intentions of ever marrying him. She just liked playing with him. It was sad that he spent his whole life pining for her. It would have been nice if ******* had married ****** but she would have just died on him anyway. ******* was a man that could not express his feelings and kept them bottled up. It was obvious that he loved ****** after the raid on Austin when the rangers got back and he ran to hold her. *** Kilmer is excellent at playing odd characters. I loved his portrayal of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best of the bunch.
