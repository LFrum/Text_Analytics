I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.<br /><br />I almost wrote ****** **** a letter to tell her how much I love it. ***** ********'s grief scene is so flippin real!!! ****** Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when ******** says "I miss ********* but I ache for *****". Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO... ****** **** and *** ******* are sooooooooooooo the perfect Chicago area couple!! I know them I swear! I'm related to them I'm sure. <br /><br />This movie is in my three times a year rotation!!! I'd watch it once a week but I'm afraid I'd get too used to it!!! I always want to make it a special day when I watch it!!
