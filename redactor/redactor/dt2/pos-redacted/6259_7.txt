******* ******** diagnoses ***** *********'s daughter and she as having a form of illness, when they believe they are seeing "The Huldre", troll-like creatures which live with "the rocks and the roots" (to quote the movie).<br /><br />Basically a family moves into an older house, which has a smaller doll-house in the backyard. The daughter (well played by ***** **********) starts to befriend the creatures, until they become vindictive. The family cat also disappears.<br /><br />There are a few good scenes with ***** ********* ("Millennium") and ******* ******** as the psychiatrist. There is also something strange which occurred to one of McDowell's patients.<br /><br />If you enjoy this type of story, you may also like "*** ******", which had a similar odd theme, and the house is haunted by bad Ronald (***** ******) only that movie is from the 70's. 7/10.
