This is one of the best presentations of the 60's put on film. ****** Penn, director of Bonnie and ***** and ****** *** ***, saw that ***** ******'s outstanding script rang with truth, and from these two talents comes solid cinema. **** Thelin's ******* ***** gives male viewers a hit of pained nostalgia for the archetypal beauty who is almost within our grasps, but, always just out of reach. Just see it, or you cinematic education will be incomplete.
