I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between **** ******(*******) and Ms. ******* *****(******* ******) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. ***** says, "I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make," to which ****** deftly responds, "Chicken's good. I like chicken." If that's not ******* ******* 101, I don't know what is.<br /><br />Another thing about this Ms. ***** character: ****** sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells him she wants to see him "one last time"(this being only the fourth time they've ever met) before she moves to her sister's house in Binghamton,NY to get away from the creeps; then he really doesn't even bat an eye while her corpse is burning in the street only minutes later. ****** never even says her first name through the entirety of the film. Not once. Never a "Get over here, ****," or a "That's a nice dress you wearing, *******" or a "Be careful, *****, or the creeps'll get ya!"<br /><br />And while this 'love' is developing between the two, ******(***** O'Herlihy) keeps his ever-watchful eyes on them. It's almost as if ****** is using her as bait to get to ******, much as he uses the camera or the car. Sure enough, when ****** bites, ****** bites back hard...in the most incredible sequence of events ever caught on film! The final fifteen or so minutes are possibly rivaled only by the final thirty minutes of ***** ***** in their brilliance. And that's giving ***** ***** a lot of credit. In what other film can you see ** ****** take out **** ****** in order to get ******* *******'s back, a troubled gang leader seemingly calling a hotline to summon neo-nazi bikers to come to his aid, and nimble Broadway dancers wearing mesh halter-tops posing as street punks, all laid down to a soundtrack written by none other than ***** ****. If that's not the highest of high comedy, then nothing is funny.<br /><br />Truthfully speaking, there are a thousand ways to state the unintentional comedy of ***** **** 3, but the only way to truly understand it is to watch it and judge for yourself.
