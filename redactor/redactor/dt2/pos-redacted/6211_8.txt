When I first saw ******* ***** it was in the excellent series about silent films called "*********". There she was in 1980, her hair defiantly bobbed as it was in the Twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly lady - the very definition of "presence". Then I saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like "Ella Cinders" and "******* and ******". Then the disappointingly sombre talkie "The Scarlet Letter". And now here she is in "The Power and the Glory" giving a performance of staggering power, working expertly alongside one of the talking cinema's finest actors - ******* *****.<br /><br />I found the movie a little lack lustre story-wise, but ***** and ***** give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter. Both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film - and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make-up and hair changes. ***** is almost unrecognisable as the elderly wife, and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently performed scenes I have ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge, even over *****. Contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and ***** is struggling to propose to her. Astonishing! What this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that ********* let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.
