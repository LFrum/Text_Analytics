Husband-and-wife doctor team ****** and ***** ****** are doing modestly well in their careers, but ***** has a gambling problem. His luck changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from *** ******'s mob and gets a big bonus from the gangleader himself. Loving his change of fortune (and snazzy new apartment), ***** continues to receive payoffs for patching up other injured members of the gang. Unfortunately, his shady deals come to light in a police raid, which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well.<br /><br />At this point the plot comes into focus, as ****** ****** has to rescue her career before her license is suspended. This involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single- handedly. <br /><br />This is not a hard-edged gangster picture, but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is some tension, but the mood is kept light by ******'s tongue-in-cheek performance of a stupid gangster who imagines himself as the "Napoleon of Crime." His other gang members also function more as stooges than hoodlums. And there's some snappy dialog between ****** and Francis, especially when she's treating his injuries at his hideout. Of course, as in all gangster flicks, there's a big shootout ending, but with a humorous twist. This is a good short film showing ****** on his rise to stardom.
