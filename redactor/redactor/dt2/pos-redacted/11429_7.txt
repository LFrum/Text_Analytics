This is one of **** ******'s best solo comedy's, before the 1927 teaming with ****** *****. Laurel is a very good actor in the film, and provides good comedy. The best scene in the film is when **** dances with *** ****** (his real-life common law wife), at the Cafe Espanol. **** does silly dances that are funny, without you hearing the music. I will recommend this to any **** ****** fan.
