Though I saw this movie about 4 years ago long before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to review it now which is unusual for me since before now I often reviewed something just after seeing it. What can I say? Well, the best performance is that of the late ***** ***** as the title character who, after finding out about a man's killing the drug-dealing boyfriend of his daughter, wants to bond with him even though he's a Madison Avenue executive who has nothing in common with the very lower-class conservative ***. In fact, there are plenty of funny scenes of *** at this guy's party making smart alecky remarks there. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they're looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after overdosing on some drugs is none other than ***** ******** making her film debut! This was a pretty hard-hitting movie for the time it was made (late '60s-early '70s) and was compelling work from scripter ****** ****** (later of Saturday Night Fever) and director **** ** ******** (later to do Save the Tiger, *****, and The Karate Kid). Certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years! ****** recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time. P.S. Among the cultural artifacts seen here are a Raggedy Ann doll, a box of Ritz crackers, a bottle of ***** ketchup, and, unique for the era, a Nixon poster asking, "Would you buy a used car from this man?"
