***** and ***** **** is a very funny movie. The first time my *** told me about it I was 7 and ***** **** had just been the Saint I had for my Communion Saint. My *** knew this, so she told me to watch this with her. I did, and have seen it many times since because it is really funny. **** Bea from the **** ******** **** was in it and *****'s grandfather was the guy who played ***** ***** in Miracle On 34th Street. So, there were lots of actors we seen on TV shows too. There is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away, and ***** keeps trying things with *** **** to help raise money so they can keep the house. That includes a boxing match with **** O'Brian who plays her older brother. This is a good and funny movie that I still love.
