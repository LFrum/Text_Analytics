Odd but wonderfully original movie. Genuinely frightening, creepy and ridiculous in equal measures. The setting of a high rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action. The thought of a secret sealed room in a place like this is good enough but when the lead naive couple start cleaning up the old bed they find in this room the scene is set for some classic chills. The cast is fantastic. ***** ******* really gets to chew some scenery after being undervalued in other Full Moon films. *** Estevez proves why brother ****** ***** is so much bigger in Hollywood - his rolling eyes during the making the bed scene are really hilarious. ******* Band co-produced with ****** ****** and this really is an exceptional Full Moon/Darkwave release. ***** ****** also directed **** ****** with *******.
