What do you mean son of actor, not an actor. You don't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar---it doesn't work that way, not in UK at any rate.<br /><br />Macbeth (this version) is a low budget Scottish movie. You can't compare this to the ******** version because ******** has all the budgets in the world. <br /><br />***** acted throughout school, but his big break came in 1985, when he landed the role of ***** **** in Britain's "***** of Sherwood" television series. He has appeared in many films since then, including "******** ****" and "Lord of the Rings 2â€³. ***** has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, Unconditional Entertainment. He recently wrapped filming on his latest movie, which stars **** *******, Jr. and *** ********. <br /><br />And all this has nothing to do with being the son of **** *******. If you think ***** said to ****, "daddy, I wanna be in Macbeth movie that they are going to film," and **** said, "sure, son, whatever you say," and made a phone call and got his son the role, you are mistaken. In fact, ***** ******* is being cut out of his father's will. Seeing as how his father is **** *******, that's a big chunk of change ***** will be losing out on. The reasoning behind the decision is apparently ****'s strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself. The relationship has become fairly strained, with ***** even threatening to change his name. <br /><br />------------------------------------ Of being the son of **** *******,<br /><br />"I realize that I'm always going to be compared to my father. There are innuendos all the time. Should I spend my whole life justifying myself?" ------------------------------------<br /><br />So stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of **** ******* (big deal!).<br /><br />***** ***** in Bullet to Beijing and you'll form a different opinion about his acting ability.
