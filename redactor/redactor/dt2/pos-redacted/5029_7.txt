As an earlier reviewer said, Travolta stole every scene he was in. Recognize the character? It was ****** *********, all grown up and still a bit sleazy, but still likable, oh yes! <br /><br />Disappointing were ******* **** and *** *******, perhaps because their characters were badly written, or they just didn't care. I kept seeing one of the Baldwins (never can remember which) in the **** role so ****'s incredible talents weren't wasted. <br /><br />***** ******** is a sweetie, but not very believable; partly the writing. Character development just wasn't a big thing in this film. Just watch it for Travolta, sit back and enjoy.
