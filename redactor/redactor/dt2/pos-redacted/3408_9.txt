I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.<br /><br />The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. ***** Bridges as ********* ***** and *** ******** as ******* ******* stand out. We all thought ******* ******* as **** was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought ******* stole the show from **** and George.<br /><br />We will enjoy the movie again!
