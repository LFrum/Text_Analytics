There's a unique place in the pantheon of **** **** films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that **** didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it **** *****, ***** *****, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that **** considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. <br /><br />*** ******* and ***** *****, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory. Along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of outlaws on the run named *****. Their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the film's plot.<br /><br />Had Wagonmaster been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by ******* and *****, both probably would have had substantial careers as B picture cowboys. In the case of ******* it would have been art imitating life. ******* was a real rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a string of horses for **** **** to use in Fort Apache. **** was struck by his presence and the rest is history. <br /><br />But the day of the B western was drawing to a close and ******* and ***** had great careers as two fine character actors.<br /><br />**** **** plays ***** ***** leader of the Mormons. Bond is a recent convert though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words. But he's the leader because of his strength of character, not his impeccable LDS theology. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader.<br /><br />In portraying the *****s, **** only had to reach back four years to his My Darling **********. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and pure evil. In fact if ****** ******* who after My Darling ********** refused to ever work for **** again was willing I could easily see him being cast as ****** ***** the head of the family. As it was ******* ****** did a fine job, this is probably the role he's most noted for. Shortly after this film was done, ****** was killed in automobile crash. He might very well have worked for **** in the future.<br /><br />**** makes the Mormons pacifists here and I don't recall that pacifism was part of LDS doctrine. Nevertheless it works here, the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the *****s. It takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them. I think that this post World War II film is trying to say that pacifism isn't always the best policy. <br /><br />Another carryover from My Darling ********** is **** ******* playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe. Part of that troupe is ****** *** who's doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in Red River. *** used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashions.<br /><br />Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I'm willing to wager in the state of Utah it's a pretty popular film.
