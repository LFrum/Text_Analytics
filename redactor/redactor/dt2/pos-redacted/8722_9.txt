What an absolutely charming movie. The cast is wonderful, and the story is witty and fun. An all around pleasant movie experience. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, it doesn't make the story any less enjoyable, in fact I didn't want it to end. I've always been a ****** ******* fan, and I was interested to see her in a comedic role. She didn't let me down, ****** *******'s performance as Ms ********* is fun to watch. I loved her interaction with **** at the music store as well as her Dancing and doing "the Dentist". It only further proved what I already knew, that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time. ****** Hawn is also delightful to watch. Her fun, gentle-hearted and lovable **** is the driving force of the movie. You don't even question why she would be so concerned about her *******'s wife, you just accept that she's just that type of person who wouldn't be happy unless she knew everyone else was also. And ****** ******* is great as Julian. His actions never create a feeling animosity for the viewer, in fact they almost make him more enduring. There wasn't an unlikable character in the bunch. This movie has definitely with stood the test of time, I watched it just last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you're looking for a fun, lighthearted, romantic comedy look no further.
