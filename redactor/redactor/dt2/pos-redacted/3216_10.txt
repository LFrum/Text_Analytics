honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore! even in one hour.. ***** and ******* ******* are KICKS (loralie's parents, ****'s grandparents) they're you're average rich parents.. ***** president of the DAR and ******* a well known lawyer and **** alumni st.. **** is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them any happier, of course, ****'s mother is so very proud of her but her whole life has worked on ultimately defying her parents and **** going to **** did not help her on that journey but believe me, every episode she does get closer ;)
