The original The Man *** **** *** **** brought ****** ********* acclaim for the first time outside of the United Kingdom. Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how ********* on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish Hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. The original film was shot inside a studio.<br /><br />For whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake, ********* now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount)decided to see what The Man *** **** *** **** would be like with a lavish budget. This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international names for box office. This was ***** *******'s third of four ********* films and his only teaming with ***** Day and her only ********* film.<br /><br />I do wonder why ********* never used ***** again. At first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that ********* favored. Possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication ********* also wanted in his blondes. <br /><br />***** does some of her best acting ever in The Man *** **** *** ****. Her best scene is when her doctor husband ***** ******* gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco. ******* and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene. But ***** especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. <br /><br />Day and ******* are on vacation with their son *********** ***** in Morocco and they make the acquaintance of ********* ****** ***** and the aforementioned English couple, ******* ***** and ****** ********. Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to ******* about an assassination to take place in ****** **** in London. Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.<br /><br />For the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a ********* film. ***** in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. The song was *** **** **** and I remember it well at the age of 9. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast rising ***** ******* that year. *** **** **** won the Academy Award for **** **** beating out such titles as **** **** from High Society and the title song from Around the World in 80 Days. It became ***** Day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.<br /><br />In fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as ***** sings it at an embassy party at the climax.<br /><br />Instead of doing it with mirrors, ********* shot the assassination scene at the real ****** **** and like another reviewer said it's not directed, it's choreographed. You'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.<br /><br />This was remake well worth doing.
