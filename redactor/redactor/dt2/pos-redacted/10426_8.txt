i LOVED THIS MOVIEE well i loved the romance part with COlby and the girl...****** (?) 4got her name....i honestly was only interested in those too. i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that. but please no more sad endings where they cant be 2gether! =( it made me cry! but the romance between them. the plot the trauma everything was great. =) i just was more into Colby and ******. ha ha =) everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat. because i sure was. Honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple (Colby and ******) and at least a decent ending. I hated the ending, a better one could have been more thought out, not the fact of forcing COlby to his death and ****** having a son. The ending would have killed the movie.
