This movie is extremely funny - the character of momma keeps me returning to the movie time and time again! I can't get enough of her dry lines ... like when she tells her son **** to bury his friend in the back yard before he smells up the place ... and her suspicion that **** is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts! It's hilarious!<br /><br />If you like movies such as National Lampoon's Vacation, ***** ****, or Planes, ****** & Automobiles, this has similar humor. It's a great, wholesome laugh ... a must see!
