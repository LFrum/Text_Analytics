This is a fine, under-rated film and *** ****, well-known as he is, is a seriously under-rated actor. I read ****** ***** ******'s novel many years ago. How well ****** captures the book and the beauty of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom! I had the good fortune to grow up in VT in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the "Irasburg Incident" took place. I've not seen ********* in the Kingdom_, the ******/Mosher collaboration based on the incident(and another Mosher novel), but this film has inspired me to track it down.
