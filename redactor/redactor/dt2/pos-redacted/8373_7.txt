The only reason The **** Is ****, one of several "race movies" made during the times of segregation, would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a 21-year-old singer named **** *****. She plays ***** *******, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor **** ***** (***** ******) in order to branch into the big time. *****, however, has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she won't feel sorry for having done so. He then teams up with *** ******* (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medicine shows throughout the south. Meanwhile, in New York, her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the specialty act. ***** finds out from the radio and offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his lineup of other specialty acts, many of whom make their one of their few or only film appearances here, for his chance at the big time with ***** next to him. Guess what happens? While the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time, the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features I've seen during this Black History Month. Ms. *****'s singing is on good display here and it's interesting seeing her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career. Among other supporting players there's an unconfirmed, according to IMDb, appearance by ******* ********, ***** in my favorite movie It's a Wonderful Life and sister of Amanda Randolph who I just saw in the musical short The Black Network, as the woman with ******** who complains of not being cured after taking the Doc's medicine before **** explains it's for the feet! And as a longtime Louisiana resident, I'd like to take note of two players from here in this movie: **** ******** from Monroe as a tonic customer and ***** ****** from New Orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. So for just **** ***** alone, The **** is **** is worth seeing at least once.
