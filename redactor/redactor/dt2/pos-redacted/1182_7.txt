A competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of **** ****** and ****** *******. I suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed the two GRUMPY OLD MEN films, as there seemed to be a bunch of these buddy team-ups spotlighting the comical duo in their twilight years. The idea is a sure-fire one: *******, a bumbling gambler who's thousands of dollars in debt, connives his unsuspecting friend ****** into taking a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies; the catch is, they've been signed on as ***** ***** and ******* can't dance.<br /><br />OUT TO SEA is a funny film, and not all of the chuckles are to be found courtesy of ****** and *******. I found ***** ****** (best known as Data from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION) to be very humorous as the snobby ball-busting dance coordinator. As the prissy boss of the two aging actors, he manages to match them in the laughs department. Though the film doesn't really need any, there's also a a love story or two to be found here as well, involving **** ****** (who looks pretty fine for her years).
