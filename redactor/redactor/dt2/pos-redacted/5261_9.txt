I am a 58 year old man.On a rainy afternoon my wife suggested that we go see The Women. After reading the reviews I thought it might lead to an afternoon nap. Wrong- this movie held my interest from start to finish. It was great to finally see *** **** looking super again. Let's face it Meg looks much better with long hair. ******* Benning looked different to me in every scene she was in. Candice ****** is showing her age as is ****** ******. The daughter, *****, was exceptionally acted by young India.I was able to understand the dialog which is tough in many current films due to rapid speech. ****** ******** and the woman from Finland were terrific as the housekeepers who extend their regular duties. The NYC scenes were nice to see. Oh, and ***** ****** had a short role but as usual was terrific. So I gave this chick flick a 9. Guys- Go see this even just for the eye candy like *** ******. It won't disappoint.
