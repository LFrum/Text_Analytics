Nice to see a comedy for grown ups. Masterfully structured by ***** ****** via **** *******'s own mastery. Mr ******'s mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and riveting ******* ****** and ********* ****** in "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and riveting ***** *******, ***** ****, **** *** and ******* ******* in "Closer". In "******* ******'s War" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting *** *****, ***** *******, ****** ******* ******* and *** ***** are at the service of something else, it's personal only to a point. Hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and ***** ******* throws parties and introduces characters with blatant straightforwardness. *** ***** witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. An insurmountable task that **** ***** manages to surmount, beautifully. It is ****** ******* *******'s Gus with a t, however, that monopolized my attention. His character may not be a first but it is a first the way that ******* presented him to us. Someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together. ******* is superb. The pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions. A sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when was the last time I was able to say that?
