Man, is it great just to see ***** and The Restless star ****** ****** ***** as something other than flighty ***** ******! A doctor with a brain no less! And super nice to see her with the likes of the gorgeous ******* ***** instead of ****** ******!<br /><br />Mel plays a college professor of micro-biology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break, only to find herself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus. Handy for her there is the hunky character played by *******, who has a daughter just her son's age.<br /><br />Mel shines, as does ******* with a bit of the overacting from the younger couple. Interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism talk. Worthwhile seeing, especially for Y&R fans.
