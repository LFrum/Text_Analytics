I've slowly been collecting the films available on DVD of both ********* ******* and ******** ********. Both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them.<br /><br />Next to "The Soft Skin", coincidentally staring *******'s sister (the late ********* *******), this would have to be my favourite ******** film.<br /><br />As well as directing, ******** also wrote the screenplay. Something that always strikes me about ******** is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivety.<br /><br />There's a scene towards the end of the film where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the loot. He rings the doorbell and ******* answers wearing a negligee. In the time it takes Belmondo to reach their room from the street, ******* changes into her dress, puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes, then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep. It's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but that's ******** for you.<br /><br />Watching ********* ******* in her films of the late 60's is indeed a sensory pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch. Incidentally, for those fans, there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure.<br /><br />I disagree with previous posters. I see nothing 'Hitchcockian' about the film at all. As for the 'look' of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's. It certainly gives films of this period a unique look.<br /><br />****** recommended for both ******* and ******** fans......
