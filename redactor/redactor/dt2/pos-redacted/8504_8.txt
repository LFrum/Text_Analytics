The famous French detective ***** ****** takes his first vacation in 11 years in St. Margot where he meets *******, the daughter of the vacation spot proprietors. Despite ******* being promised to childhood sweetheart ****, ***** and ******* fall in love and decide to marry, despite *******'s father objecting due to *****'s age. On the day of their wedding, **** returns and ******* runs after him. Nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead, and ***** swears he won't rest until he can find the killer. The only clue ***** has to work with is a footprint found by ****, but he is also getting written warnings that others will die soon. **** *******'s mother is found dead and ***** has no idea as to the identity of the killer. Thinking himself a failure he returns to Paris, then he realizes (and fears) that the killer can be only one person, even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. Out of the ordinary murder mystery that doesn't really follow the formula in other of the genre by ******** or other B studios. Credit to that certainly goes to director ***** who does manage to turn this into a noirish film despite the setting of the film, also aided by the use of good camera-work and lighting. Geray turns in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry their performance. Rating, 8.
