I consider ******** as *********'s first "American" film, because the story takes place completely in U.S.<br /><br />There are brilliant scenes in this film. Statue of Liberty Scene, ***** **** jumping into the water from the bridge, ***** fall scene are amazing. Its not *********'s fault that he didn't get the actors he wanted. ********* originally wanted **** ****** for the leading roles in Foreign Correspondent and ********. But **** ****** wasn't interested in doing a thriller. Another reason why ********* didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of top directors. Although ******* was a huge success, still most of film's success went to Producer ***** ** ********. For *******, ***** ** ******** got **** Picture Oscar for *******. And ********* didn't get a **** Director Oscar for *******. ********* started getting some attention after Foreign Correspondent (1940). But ********* gave him a low-budget for ******** (1942). ********* tried to get **** ****** for this film, because he was willing to work with ********* again with a low salary. He enjoyed working with ********* in Foreign Correspondent (1940). But he was unavailable. So the role went to ****** ********. ********* called ****** ******** "a competent performer." I thought he did his best. He was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male role.<br /><br />As for leading female role, ********* wanted ******** ******** or ******* ******** for the leading role. They weren't interested either. So ********* decided to give the role to ********* ****. I read in a book that this was one of her favorite films.<br /><br />I also liked the scene at ***** ***'s house. That is my favorite scene. If we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in ***** ******'s house, then we will see how intense it is. ***** ****** (***** ***) was studying ***** ****'s character the moment he entered his house. The moment ***** entered his house, he heard *****'s handcuffs. Through conversation, he realized that ***** **** isn't a criminal at all. We also see his hearing ability through those scenes. For *******, ***** hears the sound of a car says "Is that a car coming?" ***** ****** says "2 cars I think." ***** ****** was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. ********* **** did a fine job playing her role. She was no big star. But I thought her performance was really good. Another brilliant scene in ***** ******'s house is the scene where he asks ********* **** (******** ******) "Are you frightened, ***? Is that what makes you so cruel?" I thought **** ******* played the villain brilliantly. ********* wanted ***** ***** for the villain. But he refused. ***** ***** is famous for his role ** * President in "*** ***** goes to Washington." I want to mention more about this film. But I think my post is getting too long.<br /><br />Every ********* film is special in its own way. I am sure ********* fans will like this film. I rate 10 out of 10.
