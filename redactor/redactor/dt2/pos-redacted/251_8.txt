A good story about ***** ****** (**** ********) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with ***** (Gene Kelly) and Genius (**** *******). Rusty is in love with *****. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and Is less really more if you are happy? Answering those questions makes the movie. The movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had. Never a dull moment!
