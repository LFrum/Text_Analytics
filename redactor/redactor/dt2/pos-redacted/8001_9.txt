****** Returns is a really dark movie, that shows the Caped Crusader fighting against the Penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I'll get to them later). ******* ****** acts well as ***** *****, showing he is a good actor. *** BUrton directs this picture well, and the locations of the movie are impressive. The villains: ***** deVito is menacing as the Penguin. A cruel, yet disturbed man, that had a really hard childhood. But, ******** ******** steals the picture. She is the BEST Catwoman ever! She is threatening, and extremely sexy. There's a scene where she kisses ****** the cat way that just heats the movie up. The action scenes are good too, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending of a ****** movie. *** ****** shows he can manage a ****** movie really well (he already demonstrated this with the first ******) and also gives ****** a darker nature. So much like him.
