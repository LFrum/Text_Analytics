Pot-seeking pre-teen ****** ****** (as ***) throws his sister's doll into the river while ****** ******* (as ******) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing ***** ***** (as Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays by the "*****'s Edge", for any passerby to see. Viewing the dead body are a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners ***** ****** (as Matt) and ******* ****** (as Layne) are found most camera-worthy. The friends wonder what to do about their guilty, beer-guzzling killer friend.<br /><br />Veteran-in-the-cast ****** ****** (as Feck) keeps the youngsters' heads fed. ** * ****** once killed a woman. He lives with one of those life-sized sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action. **** Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a more living doll, and she is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is notably cross-cut with a flashback to the opening strangulation. An actual teenager, in her first feature role, Ms. Leitch is the daughter of sixties-singer *******.

Most obviously, the killer teen was teased; note his weight, attitude, and "toilet"-connected nickname. Some of the characters' relationships and motivations are too vaguely defined, but the cast certainly keeps the material interesting; and, director *** ******, photographer ********* *****, and writer **** ******* are obviously skilled.<br /><br />******* *****'s Edge (8/27/86) *** ****** ~ ***** ******, ******* ******, ****** ******, ****** ******
