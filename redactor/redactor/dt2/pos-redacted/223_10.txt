Two years after 'Airplane!' took off, *** ********, ***** and ***** ****** cast one of its stars - ****** ******* - in this hilarious television series, a glorious take-off of old U.S. detective shows such as 'Dragnet'. ******* played ***** ******, America's answer to 'Inspector ********'. It had the same style of humour as 'Airplane!'; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities, and recurring characters such as ****** the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest-stars ( including ******* *******! ) were killed off in the opening credits. 'Police *****' was the first U.S. sitcom since 'Batman' to lack a laugh track. Many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made, but I think it was about right. The concept could never have sustained a full 24-episode run. Five years later, 'Police *****' made a successful transfer to the big screen, when the first of the 'Naked Gun' trilogy was released. ***, *****, *****, and ****** had the last laugh.
