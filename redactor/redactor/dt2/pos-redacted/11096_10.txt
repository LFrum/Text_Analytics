THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a superb example of an anti-80s film. While many other films of the decade in general lacked substance, this film is pure substance. There's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it. It boasts two superb performances: ******* ****** and **** **** as lifelong friends *********** ***** and ******* ***, respectively. ******, ****, and *** ****** were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things (all 3 starred in TAPS). While **** and ******'s popularity soared, ****** has been largely forgotten about, and that's a shame. Actually, ****** is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding.<br /><br />****** really captures the post-Vietnam war rebelliousness in his character ***** *****. A failed seminary school student, ***** has a love-hate relationship with his father, well played by the great character actor *** ******. The scene where ***** quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one.<br /><br />***** gets job at Dept. of Defense and uses his hatred of U.S. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets. He gets his buddy *******, a hyper drug-dealing self-server, in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm. While ***** is doing it based on his beliefs, ******* is doing it strictly for the money. The Soviet liaison is excellently played by ***** ******. **** and Suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. But, make no mistake, this film is anything but that. It is a serious character study about pessimism, malaise, paranoia and mistrust.<br /><br />Again, the leads make this film. ****** delivers a brilliantly understated performance as *****, a rather smart young man who had so much potential. ****, as usual, does a tremendous characterization as *******, a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks, and most of the time doesn't think at all. The ending of this fact-based film is very saddening on several levels. A truly powerful character study.
