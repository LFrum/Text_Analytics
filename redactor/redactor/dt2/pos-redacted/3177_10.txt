"The Honkers" is probably **** ******* best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that **** was ******* ***** material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a ***** **** picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to "The Honkers". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. *** *********'s "****** ******" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, ***** ********* had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too. The picture is worth watching, if just for the rodeo footage--some of the best ever filmed--shot by ***** ******. The director and my co-writer, ***** *****, died a few weeks after the picture's release, cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife *****, his daughter, ****, and newborn son, ******. Please give this movie a shot. I'm betting that you'll say it was well worth while. I thank anyone who has taken the time to read this. ******* Lodge
