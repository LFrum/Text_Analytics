****** and Scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest American films of the past 20 years. ****** ****** didn't make a huge initial splash, and I still don't think it's received the credit it deserves. The immediate clamor surrounding the film ("Some porn movie with ***** ****") was wholly without merit. What **** ****** ******** has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the American Dream (if such a thing still exists).<br /><br />For those of you who have been living in a box (or a confessional) for the past 8 years, ****** ****** tells the literal rise-and-fall tale of young ***** ***** (Wahlberg). ***** is just a dopey kid from Torrance, California who wants something more out of life. His room is soaked in muscle-bound, naive Americana. His dreams are far bigger than his potential, but not quite as large as his...special gift. His bald-headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming, omni-present adult film industry. **** Horner (Burt Reynolds as the film's twinkle-eyed **** ****) gets wind of *****'s hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie.<br /><br />Before you can say "deep-throat," ***** has changed his name to **** ******* and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public. Fame and fortune make ****'s acquaintance, as do a bevy of local porn celebs. His friends and co-workers become his makeshift family, but it soon proves to be a Sunday picnic like no other. As the feel-good 70s give way to the coke-addled, video-friendly 80s, **** & Co. begin a dangerous backslide. <br /><br />******** put everything he had into this glorious, moving epic. It sizzles and never fizzles. Nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO fades from the soundtrack. See this one immediately. And then watch it again.<br /><br />And again.
