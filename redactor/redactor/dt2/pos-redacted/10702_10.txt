Canadian film-maker *** ******* delivers a solid, non-stop thrill ride of relentless horror with the superb 1991 sci-fi film "Science ******". A hideous monster takes revenge on his mother, a police officer and tenants of an apartment building. Brilliant practical make-up and special effects designs create a truly terrifying monster, especially when lurking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment settings. The characters are developed beautifully with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from an ensemble cast. Produced by ***** *******, newcomer *** ******* also penned the film's face-paced script, weaving together an engaging roller-coaster ride of twists, turns, and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame. Science ****** will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
