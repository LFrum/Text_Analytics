I really enjoyed ****** ******. I discovered the film by accident, searching through my On-Demand movie lists trying to find something interesting to watch. The film is mostly about class in America, and it quickly grabs your attention. The characters are smart and articulate and the story doesn't stick to the usual Hollywood rules.<br /><br />The main protagonist is ****, a precocious, but underprivileged 15 year old who spends his summer with the ******** family. ****** Sutherland plays the patriarch, ***** ** *******, the seventh richest man in America. ***** **** plays ****'s mother, a friend of ***** who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut. The ********s own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules. At first they seem charming and sophisticated but the super-rich are different. They are used to getting their own way. The film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog, superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns. It is also an R rated movie, so it's not entirely wholesome. <br /><br />The cast is excellent. ***** ******* is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of ****. Sutherland and ***** **** have never been better. ***** Evans is impressive as ********'s devious grandson. ******* ******* is good as the pretty grand daughter. High quality movie.
