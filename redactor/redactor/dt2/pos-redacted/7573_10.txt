***** ***** and ****'s Winters end was the best movie I have ever seen. The person in the story that I liked best had to be ****** played by ***** ******. Just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind. For example when **** calls from town ****** wants to answer and she says,"*****? **** guess what. Grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man!" I loved all of the ***** ***** and tall movies for my rating I think ***** ***** and tall was #3. ******* was #2. Winters end was #1! If I could live in any family from the past It would have to be the Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie I can't name all of them. I think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past I would highly highly highly recommend ***** ***** and ****'s Winters end.
