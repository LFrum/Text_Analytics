This short was the first short released by Paramount ****** ******* and was one of several done by the studio showing ****** engaged directly against the enemy, most often the Japanese. While Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios, did shorts often depicting Germans as foils, the majority of ****** ******* efforts focused on the Japanese. Given ***** ****** and ******'s naval ties, this is quite understandable. This is an average short. *****' Red, White an' **** and ******* For Britain have aged better. But it's still worth watching. Recommended.
