'The ******* *******' can rightly be compared to the films of ***** ****, whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of ******' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired the director ******* *********. The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war. The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by ***** ******* and a married woman played by ******* ***** Thomas.<br /><br /> The story, based on a novel by ******* ********, is told in flashbacks by *******' ***** ****** de Almasy - the titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in Europe by ****, an army nurse played by ******** *******. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers. The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. If you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The ******* *******' speaks directly to you.<br /><br />
