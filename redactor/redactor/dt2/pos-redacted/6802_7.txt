This was one of the first color films I have seen at the cinema when I was a child. It is good to remember it. The girl, *** ******, who later became a beautiful woman, starred together with the tiny and excellent actor ****** ******. The content of the film plot is good for all ages, good wills and behavior. Good ethics of ******'s parents, particularly her mother is something to take into account. Our generations should be well educated and this film may help to this purpose. ****** loves the horses and racing them, and ** ****** (Rooney) brought her to an international horse racing competition in England, where at the end the young ****** won, but was disqualified because of being female.
