"National ******" tells the story of ****** *****, a young English girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse into competition at the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her as she trains her horse with the aid of a former jockey and the support of her parents.<br /><br />While "National ******" is a family film that fact shouldn't deter anyone who typically views such films with derision. The film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family, not just attention-addled youngsters. It even managed to land five Oscar nominations, hardly a sign of slacking off for a general audience.<br /><br />**** ******, in the part of ******'s mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12-year old ********* ****** who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. Also on board are Oscar-winner ****** ***** as ******'s father, ****** ****** as former jockey Mi Taylor and ****** ******** (in one of her earliest film roles) as ******'s older sister.<br /><br />The film's lustrous Technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing secured the second of the film's two Oscars. Additionally, the film was nominated for its direction (by ******** *****), cinematography & art direction. The score by ten-time Oscar nominee ******* ******** is also worth mentioning, though it went unnominated.<br /><br />All in all, "National ******" is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn't exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on.
