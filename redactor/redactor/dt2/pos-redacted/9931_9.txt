Beware the Scottish Play! In his riveting and harrowing *****, ***** ******* returns to classic form, regaining the composure he lost while filming convoluted and delirious psycho- shockers like ******* and *********. Indeed, predicated on a simple narrative that is offset by opulent set pieces, imaginatively brutal murder sequences, and refined photography, the film feels like the Argento we once knew. *****'s only real infraction is its lack of a score by ******, who provided unusual, iconic, and timeless music for many of Argento's greatest films (the opera selections used here are wonderful, however).<br /><br />The production is filled out by several competent actors. While she's no ******* ******, ********* ******* lookalike ******** ********** manages enough pluck and compassion to grasp the role of the tortured heroine. *** ********* is interesting as horror-film-helmer- turned-opera-director *****. And ***** ******** is fantastic as always, even in her relatively brief role (watch the making of featurette on the DVD for a hilarious interview with ******** about her role -- clearly brash and resentful over the end of her relationship with Argento!) Fans of ***** ****** (another excellent 1987 giallo, directed by ******* *****, who served as the second unit director for *****) will barely recognize the final girl from that film, ******* *******, as a stage manager here (I think it's the glasses that do it).<br /><br />With me, it's often the little things that matter, and Argento's fascination/obsession with solitary nightmarish images makes him my ideal filmmaker. ***** is full of minor details that left me smirking. For instance, I love that we never see "The Great" **** *******'s face. I also love the scene where the killer is scraping the tip of his/her deadly sharp dagger across a television screen showing *****'s performance as **** *******. Finally, I defy even the most grizzled slasher veterans not to cringe as the "pin grates" are placed over *****'s eyes.<br /><br />In short, ***** is a clean, tense, and taut thriller. With its solid performances, lucid focus, and literate cinematography, it begs to be in the same league as **** *** and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. ***** ***** be the last great giallo?
