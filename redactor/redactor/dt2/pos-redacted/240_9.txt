In Brooklyn, the nightclub dancer ***** ****** (**** ********) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend ***** (**** *****). Rusty, ***** and ****** (**** *******) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway, whose owner proposes her. She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style, missing the love of ***** and her old friends. 'Cover ****' is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and having magnificent parts, such as the beauty and talented **** ******** dancing, singing and acting; **** *****, specially in two scenes, dancing with himself and with Rusty and ****** on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars. *****, the character of **** *****, is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior. **** ******** surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in 'Gilda', but she is stunning in 'Cover ****'. In accordance with the information on the cover of the VHS, 'Cover ****' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, instead of just being 'thrown' in the movie. My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent **** ***** festival and they loved 'Cover ****', therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Modelos' ('Models')
