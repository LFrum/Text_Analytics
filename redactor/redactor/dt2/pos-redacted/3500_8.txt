By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable *** * as a candidate for ******* in the local elections, nasty chancellor ***** ******* (******* *****) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, *** is embraced by the nation, and ******* is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.<br /><br />Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: *** * *********, the big-screen debut outing for ****** ***** *****'s middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!!<br /><br />Obviously, there are those who are simply not going to get the joke, and there will definitely be people who find risqué jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography, and The Queen's nether regions offensive in the extreme (needless to say, they should stay well away!), but if you find such juvenile humour side-splittingly hilarious, are a fan of ***** ***** in general, or just want to see hottie ***** ***** in her underwear (and you shud, cuz she iz well fit!), then I fully recommend spending an hour and a half in the company of *** * and the West ******* ******* *<br /><br />They iz wicked!
