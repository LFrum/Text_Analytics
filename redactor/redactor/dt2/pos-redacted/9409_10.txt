I'd heard of the case, but hadn't really paid attention during the whole hoopla of ******* writing the book, ****** being arrested, etc. However, this movie did an excellent job of detailing ******, the ****** brothers, the murder, **** *******'s involvement and the results of his investigation. I especially liked the flashback scenes with ****** talking about her last summer. The actress who played her literally glowed with life and made it even more poignant that the real ****** was probably like that. It made ****** seem like a real person rather than a victim. I'd definitely recommend watching this.
