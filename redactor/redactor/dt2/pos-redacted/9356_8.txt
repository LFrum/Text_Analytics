A man by the name of ****** ******* is found brutally murdered in his apartment. It would appear that ******* was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the previous evening, and with one of them seemingly missing, the evidence certainly implicates the missing soldier. But as detective Finlay digs deeper into the case he finds that they could be barking up the wrong tree, and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and vile, anti-Semitism.<br /><br />Crossfire was born out of the novel written by ******* ******, adapted by **** ****** and directed by the shrewdly excellent ****** ******, Crossfire {originaly titled ****** Of Fear} is a taut and gripping picture that boldly tackles anti-Semitism. Tho the makers were forced to tone down the story from the original source, the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti-Semitism, what remains, largely due to RKO supremo **** ****** and producer ****** *****, is a sort of creeping unease that drips with ****ish style.<br /><br />The cast features three ***'s, *****, ******* and ****, with **** darling ****** ******* adding the emotional female heart. Tho only third billed, it's ****** ****'s picture all the way, his portrayal as the bullying, conniving ********** is from the top draw and perfectly showcases the talent that he had in abundance. **** had good cause to give ********** some of is best work for he had served in the ******'s with ******* ****** himself, both men having discussed the possibility that if the novel was to be made into a film?, then **** wanted in and to play **********, thus the genesis of ****'s career as weasel types was born!. ****** ******* also puts in a wonderful and heartfelt turn, which is all the more remarkable since she was being plagued by her abusive husband at the time. ******* ******** was known to be violent towards her and his constant presence around the set irked others in the cast, but *******, probably channelling real life emotion, became the character of ***** and shone very bright indeed. Both *** ******* and *** ***** come out with flying colours as well, to really seal the deal on what a smartly acted picture Crossfire really is.<br /><br />Tho Crossfire was released before the other 1947 anti-Semitic picture, *********'s Agreement, and raking in over a million and a quarter dollars at the box office, some of its thunder was stolen by the Academy Award winning picture from *** ******. Nominated for **** *******, **** ********** Actor {****}, **** ********** ******* {*******}, **** ******** and **** **********, it won nothing, but critics of the time hailed it as a brilliant shift in American Cinema, and today it stands tall, proud and dark as a bold and excellent piece of work. 8.5/10
