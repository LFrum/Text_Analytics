Okay, it's too long and it's too satisfied with itself. Still, "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating movie. ******* does a terrific job satirizing ****** and trying to portray the oppression of the Jews in Nazi Germany (this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge). Not a ******* masterpiece, but still worth seeing.<br /><br />
