Alright, so maybe the impersonations of *** **** and ***** ********* are not spot on, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. *** Balaban and ***** ******** are excellant as ****** *********** and ******* Ovitz.<br /><br />The movie doesn't go for joke and punchline but it is still funny. ***** Bates in particular is amazing as ****'s manager.<br /><br />Funny, amazing, interesting, very watchable, this is a good TV movie.
