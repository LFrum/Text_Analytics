"Damaged *****" is far ahead of it's times in educating it's viewers about the dangers ******** *******. viewed now over 70 years after it's release back in 1933 is as good, if not better, then the many films about that subject made back in the 1940's 1950's and even 1960's.<br /><br />****** *******, ***** ********, is a top executive of a major shipping company who's been going study with his girlfriend ****, ***** ********, for some time. both are finally planing to get married and raise a family. Out at a party one evening ****** meets ***** ******, ********* *******, and together they have one drink too many and before you know it end up spending the night together in *****'s home. <br /><br />Thinking nothing of his one night stand with ***** ****** later marries his long time love **** and they both plan to have a child, or so they thought. At the office ****** get a panicked call from ***** telling him to come over to her place right away about something very important. Rushing over ****** finds out, to his horror, that ***** has a sexual infection that she got from her boyfriend ***, ***** *****, and that she may have given it to ******, and he in turn may have infected his wife ****. Telling ***** that she's wrong about him being infected and that she should seek medical attention ***** shoots herself as ****** is just about to leave. <br /><br />Getting over *****'s tragic death ****** gets another surprise later when his doctor Dr. **** ****, ***** ******* **, comes over to his office telling him to immediately come with him to the hospital to talk to ********** ******* ********** Dr. Vincent *******, ****** *******, about his wife **** who's just been admitted there. The terrible truth about ****** and his wife **** hits him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless, just like it did **** earlier. Both have been infected and the infection is the dreaded and unspeakable,back in the 1930's, infection called Venereal Disease. <br /><br />Told by Dr. ******* that it would take some two years of treatment for both ****** and **** to be completely cured it leaves **** in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. Later in the film ****, feeling that she has nothing to live for, closes all the windows in her and ******'s apartment and turns on the gas stove, full blast, in order to kill herself and ****** who was asleep at the time. <br /><br />Honest film about the ravages of Venereal Disease and the damage that it does to those who are infected by it, both psychically as well as mentally, and how it could be cured if given immediate medical care instead of hiding it from one's doctor and keeping it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it's too late.
