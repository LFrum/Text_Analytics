I watched this episode a lot of times because I didn't get how **** died. This is what happened. ****, *****, and ****** try and save their innocent,A Doctor, because **** wants to kill him. ****** goes upstairs to look in The Book Of Shadows while **** and ***** are protecting their innocent. **** appears while ****** is still upstairs, so **** throw an energy ball at the doctor but **** pushes him out of the way and **** get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall, same with *****. So ****** comes downstairs and says the spell, since it was only ****** who said it and not the power of three **** only got wounded. ******s calls *** to heal ***** and ****. So *** heals them. ****** went into the Underworld to find ****, meanwhile **** and ***** are looking for **** in the streets. ***** and **** see **** and ***** uses her Power to Blow up ****, meanwhile a New reporter got it all on tape. So its all over the new about the three powerful Halliwell sisters, meanwhile ****** doesn't know anything because she is still in the Underworld. There's Repoters and people all over the Halliwell house. Then a maniac comes in the house and says "Can I be Part Of Your Coven?" and **** says "No this is our house get out of here!" and **** uses her powers to throw her out. As the maniac come out of the house crying saying "There Mean Witches". The maniac gets so mad that she shoots ***** right through the stomach. **** get in her car and trays to go to the hospital but people won't let her through ,so **** uses her powers to move people out of the way, making people wanna kill her more. They got to the hospital but ***** didn't make it. Meanwhile ****** is in the Underworld.****** finds out that they have been exposed, so ****** asks **** to ask the source if he can reverse time.The ****** says he will only reverse time if ****** promises to stay here in The Underworld, so **** told ****** what the source told him. ****** says "What would Make him think i would make a deal like that?" and then **** says, "So you can save one of your sisters lives." *** goes to the hospital to find out the ***** really is dead so he tells ****** that its true. Then ****** agrees to stay only if **** will go back to warn ***** and **** about the exposer and death of *****. Back at the hospital SWAT is about the shoot ****, but the second before they do time is rewound back when they were at the manor with the doctor but this time ****** wasn't there to call *** to heal **** and *****, so the doctor get throw in the wall too. The doctor died and so did ****. But this is what I didn't get, if ***** was throw against the wall too how come only **** died? Why did they not show *** come and heal ***** and *** trying to heal ****? If you know the answer please e-mail me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS.
