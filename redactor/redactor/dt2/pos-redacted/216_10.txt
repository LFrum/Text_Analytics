The inspiration for the "Naked Gun" movies casts ****** ******* - who had only recently started doing comedy* - as the incompetent but heroic ***** ******, always having to solve an absurd case. Like "Airplane!" and the movies based on the series, the humor relies on *** Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (namely the "yes it is" remarks), along with the fact that ******* remains very serious despite the nonsense around him. And of course, the final frame, in which something keeps moving.<br /><br />It's too bad that the show only had six episodes. At least it spawned the movies. You can't go wrong with ****** ******* in these sorts of roles. I suspect that they all had fun filming it. Really funny.<br /><br />*Before "Airplane!", ****** ******* had starred in movies like "Forbidden Planet", "******" and "The Poseidon Adventure". As late as 1987 he co-starred in "Nuts" alongside ****** ********* and ******* ********. But since the first "Naked Gun" movie it's been all comedy all the time.
