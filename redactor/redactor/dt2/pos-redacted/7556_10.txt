Film follows four friends from the 1950s (when they're in high school) up to 1981. They are ****** (***** ******) a Yugoslavian immigrant; ******* (Jodi Thelan) a "free spirit"; ***** (******* **********) who has no personality and *** (*** *******) a big, strong, handsome, rugged guy. All three of them are in love with ******* but she only loves ******. The film mostly focuses on those two--it chronicles their lives, love and attraction to each other over the years. It also gets into ****** trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father. <br /><br />I love this film but it's not without its bad points. Thelan's high, squeaky voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story jumps around very quickly; *** and *****'s lives are never explained (*** shows up with a Vietnamese wife and kids and ***** has a wife we never meet until the end); some crucial scenes are badly written and there's some obvious pre-release cutting (probably to keep the film at 2 hours).<br /><br />But everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems. The story is compelling--you really get to know and understand the characters and always get caught up in the lives. With a few exceptions, the script (by ***** ******) is good--in fact, ****** was a Yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the script on his own experiences. All the acting is great--especially Thelan and Wasson--also **** ****** throws in a strong, likable performance as *****, ******'s college roommate. And **** ***** is very interesting in her role. And look quick for Mercedes Ruehl and ****** ******!<br /><br />Basically, it's a real great story about immigrants, coming of age, love of America and covers the 50-80s perfectly.<br /><br />This film was (unjustly) maligned on its release. The studio didn't know how to advertise it (it IS a hard film to market) and the critics stomped on it (******* *****' review in "The New Yorker" was particularly harsh). It barely played in theaters (I was lucky enough to catch it in 1981 in its short theatrical run) and has simply disappeared. That's a shame. This is a movie that is just ripe for reissue. I'm not betting on it--but you never know! A definite 10 all the way!
