For a movie that was PG, this is one fun film. I grew up on watching this film over and over. Its really fun, I don't know how today audience would react, but if you grew up on it, or loved the 80s, then this is a great film. ******* Furst is great as ******, who, I think, is one of the best characters in the film. **** ******* also pops in for about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.
