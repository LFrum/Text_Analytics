Good footage of World War I-era ships and planes supplement this excellent war drama set in the Adriatic. ****** ****** is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first. ****** Montgomery is the Lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role that a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions, endangering the submarine and its crew but finally becomes a "real man" after he is court martialed and dismissed from the Navy. ****** Young plays a lieutenant junior grade and ***** ******* as a cook. Paralleling the war drama is an equally important wartime love triangle between Montgomery and ***** ***** who plays ******'s daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator. Recommended.
