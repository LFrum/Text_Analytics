Wonderful family film that should be a staple at Christmas time. It's a mystery to me why it isn't. A true lost film that I first encountered, flickering away on my old 19" black and white RCA, when the Million Dollar Movie was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York City. This ******* **** directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone's Christmas tree. But it has never been released on home video. Too bad. I believe I saw part of it on AMC a few years ago, before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. TCM should take up the slack and play it at Easter or on ********* ***. Any movie with *****, **** ***, the Hostess Cupcake Lady, and an actor with the first name King, can't be bad. *** Blyth as "Sally" is a bundle of energy. During her school years, she rushes over to the chapel to pray for St. *** to help and give guidance to her mixed-up and financially strapped family. It works. So, after she graduates, she places a statue of St. *** in her own bedroom. At one point the entire O'Moyne residence is moved to another address. I think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the O'Moynes and the dastardly fellow next door. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund **** can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. All-in-all, this is a satisfying movie experience.
