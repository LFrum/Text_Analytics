This movie is based on the true story of *********** ***** and his friend ******* ***. This fascinating story takes place around the time of the Whitlam Dismissal, in which during his time as a clerk for TRW, *********** was privy to classified correspondence which admitted the CIA's involvement in Australian political and union circles. The movie shows several scenes involving ***** ******* (transmitted over US TV), where events take place which confirm the classified documents that *********** had read previously. The removal of ***** ******* was an organized CIA coup. Elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of deception that goes on, ultimately to ensure that the US is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the behest of everyone else. In the current age, nothing has changed.<br /><br />***********'s life was profoundly affected, read shocked, by his knowledge of what and how the CIA shapes foreign democracies, including the democracies of allied nations to the United States. *********** reacted, probably not in the best way at the time, by selling top secret information to the Soviet Union with ******* *** acting as his exchange. Eventually *********** and ******* were captured and convicted of treason.<br /><br />On 23rd May 1982, whilst serving time in US prison, *********** ***** agreed to a one and only interview with *** ****** of 60 Minutes Australia because it was the Australian connection that profoundly affected him. It caused a furore in the Australian media for about a week, then it went hushed.<br /><br />I liked the movie's symbolism of the falcon, and in it ***** was called the Falcon, and ******* the Snowman (drug connection), but in reality the title "Falcon" was not something that was used by *****.<br /><br />*********** *****: Criminal or Man of Conscience? You decide.<br /><br />Resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html
