Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of **** ****) but I think ****** is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character. ****** ****** is, well, ****** ******. ***** ******* is a delight to watch in this type of role, which he always did so well and so wittily. Bella *****'s performance as ***** is classically camp, and I find even ******* *******'s rather dry portrayal of ******** to have its own appeal.<br /><br />The historical oddity of ********'s monotheism, a brief detour in ancient Egypt's theological history, is interesting, as is ******** himself, and well worth reading about; the religious wars portrayed here have a basis in fact.<br /><br />An interesting footnote regarding *****, whose birth name was ***** ******: she was a Polish emigre who producer ****** ****** and his wife ****** took under their wing (I believe they may even have adopted her). Her screen name ***** is formed from *******'s and his wife's first names. She continued her acting career in France, but never achieved great success and, after a rather unhappy life, died at her own hand in 1971.<br /><br />Altogether this is an interesting film and enjoyable to watch for the visual values alone. American Movie Classics shows this occasionally in letterbox, which is essential to capturing the scope and sweep of the story.
