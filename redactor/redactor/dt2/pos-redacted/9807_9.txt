You got it right! ***** was ****'s imaginary friend through the whole movie, even at the beginning when on their way to California. His mother knew of ***** and didn't discourage **** leaning on ***** since imaginary friends are common with young children.<br /><br />That's why they both got stomach aches at the same time. That's why the boys' were so close.<br /><br />At the end **** was letting ***** go. The "King" was arrested. **** could go on without *****. It's also why ****'s mother didn't seem disturbed when **** received the postcard (**** had written & mailed) from ***** the Ol' West tourist stop and the other postcards from all over the world. You noticed ****'s mother turned the first card over and looked at the postmark. What a great mom doing the best she could in the late sixties.<br /><br />A 9 out of 10 for me. Brought back memories...
