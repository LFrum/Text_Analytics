This is another case of ********* ********* presuming to eclipse French Style. The original, *** **** ce heros, was one of the most charming films of 1991 so naturally the accountants in Hollywood thought they could hire ********* and phone the rest in. They did, however, take the precaution of hiring ******* ***** to write an English version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original. ********* brings his Gallic charm and ********* ***** shows all the promise that is now paying off. The thing is that when the French make a sort of Lolita-lite they get away with it because the 'dirty French postcard' thinking works in their favour; here the Hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have ********* (totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover), prevailed upon to play and song 'something French', launch into a spirited version of Thank Heaven For Little Girls. See the original.
