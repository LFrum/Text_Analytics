This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (******) torturing or nailing ***'s hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see ****** disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was "There was no ******". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ***. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ***. It was ****** all the time. But in real, ****** was ***. If they were two different people, then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times? But of course before that, u do see both of them together and THAT cud just be ***'s imagination at work. Also, when *** was out of jail, the text on screen clearly says that ***'s story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained (read mine, cars etc...)Even after *** ****** leaves ****** and comes back to find ***, she doesn't find him. Why??? Because *** (******) was out looking for the gals. Instead ****** has all the time in the world to check out ******'s (***) Web cam, photos etc...<br /><br />Somehow everything sums up to just one fact that ****** and ***, both of them knew that ****** was ***. So, my conclusion is that *** was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and ****** in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination. Otherwise if there really was a ******, then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ***.
