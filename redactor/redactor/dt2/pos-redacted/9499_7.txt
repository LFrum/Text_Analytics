Gloria ******* (as ***** ******) is an understandably bored wife. Workaholic husband ******* ****** (as ***** ***** ******) has "lost his romance" along with his waistline; he also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions, and snores. He can barely remember his own anniversary - which is attended by caddish *** **** (as ******** *** *******); the younger man eyes Ms. *******'s voluptuous figure, and flirts unabashedly. Soon, ******* is drawn to *** ****. Then, *** ****** decides to try and get her back. Who will win? <br /><br />The three principals are fine, with ******* most impressive in the pivotal role as the woman torn. ***** Faye grabs supporting honors as ****'s other interest, "*******"; off-screen, she tempted director ***** ** *******. The DeMille touch is evident; especially in an imaginary sequence wherein **** promises *******... "Pleasure Wealth Love" <br /><br />******* Don't Change Your Husband (1/26/19) ***** ** ******* ~ Gloria *******, ******* ******, *** ****
