<br /><br />"Lets swap Murders- your wife, my father"- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - ***** ******* and *** ****** when they meet over lunch on a train journey. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious ******, won't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter ****, laughs the whole conversation off as a joke. The following week he isn't laughing any more. In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense, ***** stalks ****** through a carnival and strangles her. As he does, her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses. Cold hearted and amoral *****, his part of the deal completed, approaches an appalled Guy expecting, even pressuring him into 'doing his bit.' Matters are not helped when ****'s precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting Guy of ******'s murder. So accused of a murder he didn't commit and expected to commit another, what is Guy going to do? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock does to perfection.
