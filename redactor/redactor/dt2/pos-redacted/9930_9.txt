Horror-genius ***** ******* is one of my personal favorite directors, and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" range high on my personal all-time favorite list. "Opera" of 1987 is yet another tantalizing and brilliant film that no Horror lover can afford to miss, and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end. This stunning and ultra-violent ****** could well be described as the master's nastiest film, which is quite something considering that *******'s films are not exactly known for the tameness of their violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes Opera a film censor's nightmare.<br /><br />- Warning! SPOILERS ahead! - <br /><br />Just when ***** (********* **********), a young opera singer, is becoming successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her... The murders are truly brutal, and of particularly sadistic nature. The killer attaches needles to the tied up *****'s eyelids, so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in abhorrent ways. When done with the butchering, the killer releases ***** and leaves, just to come back for other friends of hers...<br /><br />As usual for *******'s films, the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. "Opera" truly is a brutal film, and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is. This film is absolutely tantalizing and pure suspense from the beginning to the end. The performances are entirely very good, especially ********* ********** is brilliant in the lead. A stunning beauty and great actress alike, ********** fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer, whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy. Other great performances include those of *** ********** as a Horror film director who is directing an Opera, and director *******'s real-life girlfriend ***** ********, who has a role in many of his movies. The camera work is excellent as in all ******* films and The huge ***** ***** is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the film's beauty and its permanently creepy atmosphere. The score, which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too, even though I slightly missed ******'s brilliant Progressive Rock Soundtracks that are such a distinguishing element of most other ******* movies. "Opera" truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking ****** experience. This is an absolute must-see for any Horror lover, and I highly recommend it to any other film-fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tantalizing!
