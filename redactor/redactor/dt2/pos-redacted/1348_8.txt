I caught this film at an OutFest screening in Los Angeles in July, 2006. It's rough around the edges (sound recording in particular is wobbly) and often very funny. The script is rather jarringly episodic and ends abruptly, but *** ********* infuses the film with lots of genuine heart. It's also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay film that doesn't star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing straight guys. Props to a warmly sympathetic ******** ******** as *** ***, a kindred spirit to ****** (*** *********), the lively and spirited ****** ***** as ******'s best friend, and ******* ******* as ******'s mom, who is given the best one-liners in the script and steals her every scene. The film is like its writer/director/starÂ—lumpy and a bit odd, but also very sweet.
