This exploration of a unique decade in US cinema begins with the fall of one ailing, out-of-touch empire and culminates with the unstoppable rise of another, equally associated with escapism and box office receipts. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Or, as ***** ***** observed in Easy Rider, "We blew it." In between, from Bonnie And ***** to **** ****, the young Turks (some under the guerrilla tutelage of ***** ******) were creeping under the wires to produce some of the greatest artworks of the 20th century. While the story is already familiar from ***** *******'s **** ******, ****** ***** directors ***** and LaGravenese are less concerned with muckraking than in providing a platform for the filmmakers and stars themselves.<br /><br />Everyone from ****** ******** to ******* **** ******* and ***** ******** is interviewed and a roster of well edited clips places the decade in a socio-cultural and economic context. If their responses are self-congratulatory (to say the least), they're also highly quotable, funny and revealing, making this something of a cinephile's wet dream. Director ******* ******** reveals how the original The Exorcist poster was to feature a little girl's hand holding a bloodied crucifix and the legend 'For God's sake, help her", before he complained. Former ****** **** *' head **** ****** recalls that when he first saw ****** ** **** in Mean Streets he assumed ******** had secured a psychopath's day release for the shoot.<br /><br />Happily, a certain amount of hard perspective has crept into the mix, as might be hoped from a politically motivated, consciousness-expanded generation; ****** stresses "there's a lot of real crap in there too". ***** ******** observes that 1970s US cinema was "not a good time for women". But if ***** responds with a spoonful of sops to women's movies - brief clips of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, They Shoot ******, Don't They and Klute - we're soon dragged back to the usual male wall-pissing contests.<br /><br />The shift from tough, socially-conscious film-making to no-risk crowd-pleasers like Jaws for 'Nam-weary, fantasy-craving audiences is also documented, though a little rushed. But kudos too, for the inclusion of lesser-sung, but equally relevant films like ***** In Needle Park and ***. "We weren't handsome," muses ***** **** on his contemporaries. "But we were f****** interesting."
