While driving in a dangerous zigzag manner on a lonely road in the night, the teenager ***** (*** ** ********) has a car accident with his friends Lauren (********* ******), Alex (*** ******) and Eric (*********** *********). While spending the cold night stranded in the woods around a campfire, they kill time telling ghost stories. In "The Honeymoon", the couple **** (*** **********) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) travels in their RV to *** ***** in their honeymoon. **** takes a shortcut to visit the Clayton Caverns in the night, but the stranger Cole (Hawthorne James) advises them to leave the spot since dangerous creatures attack people in the full moon. In "People Can Lick ***", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (**** *******) tells her Internet friend ******* that she is alone at home. However, ******* is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket", the biker ***** (***** *****) is crossing the country on his motorcycle. When he has a problem with his bike, he finds an isolated house where the gorgeous dumb Heather Wallace (******* *******) lives with her father. When the man returns from his herd, ***** finds the truth about Heather.<br /><br />"******** *****" presents three good horror tales, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and a surprising twist in the end. The weakest segment is "The Hook", with ***** and *****, but the other stories a great. The plot point is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this above average horror movie. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazul): "Contos da Meia-Noite" ("******** *****")
