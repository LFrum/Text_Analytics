***** ****** is ****** ********'s mustached detective ******* ****** in "After the Funeral," produced in 2005. Anyone who has heard ***** ****** speak with his own British accent knows what a shock it is, because his accent as ****** is so perfect and organic to the character. ****** is the ****** of ****** ********'s books, and although I confess a love for ***** ******* in the role, his portrayal doesn't have that much to do with what ******** wrote.<br /><br />In this episode, ****** is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. Enroute on the train, the solicitor recounts the events after the death - a strange will disinheriting the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister that he was murdered. When ****** meets the family, he discovers adultery, lots of secrets, another will and murder.<br /><br />The story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful, detailed depiction of the time period. All of the acting is superb, particularly from ****** *****, who plays **** *********. ****** here is without Hastings, his beautiful office, or **** ***** but he's effective nonetheless.<br /><br />I had the privilege of seeing ***** ****** on Broadway in "*******." Breathtaking. What an actor - when he's playing ******, all I see IS ******.
