I think ****** did her evil part very well she should have won an award. Anything that ***** is in. is salvageable because ***** is a great actress and can pull anything off, even a weak script. Therefore I WOULD recommend it for this reason alone. This movie may have been a little ahead of it's time, the plot might be more acceptable these days.<br /><br />During the golden age of Hollywood movies were meant to entertain or teach, mostly to make us feel good or cope with the times. This plot seem to deviate from that profile. Yet, again I must say what ever ***** ***** was in, at least, was "good" because she made things so believable! The only other actress I can say made me think this way was maybe, ******* ****. ***** ****** **** if you get the chance for the "acting" if nothing else.
