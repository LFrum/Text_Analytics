When this was first aired on *********** *******, it had a profound effect on me. It's beautifully filmed and acted. I immediately read the book by **** ****, and it remains one of my all time favorites. ***** McTeer is wonderful as ****, and I fully expected her to become a regular on the British drama scene. I guess she chose to focus on the British stage instead. <br /><br />I was hoping that with the American success of ***** McTeer years later(with Tumbleweeds) this film would again become available to us. Alas, it has not yet been released on DVD. If anyone out there is listening, please make this available again!
