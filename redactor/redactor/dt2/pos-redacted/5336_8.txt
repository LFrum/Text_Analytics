Although it isn't half as hilarious as "******* ***," the new ******* and ****** comedy "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" (*** out of ****) yields more laughs than most live action comedies. British director **** ****, who created the ******* and ****** characters, and co-director ***** *** rely on the old-fashioned, stop-motion method of animation--known best as claymation--to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side-splitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight. Amusing as its whimsical storyline is, the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which **** and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called **********. Basically, every shot that you see in "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment. ********* pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. ******* Studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day. For the record, "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" took five years to make. The lumpy looking characters, with thumb-prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions, look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and over-biting mouths. Interestingly, ****** emerges as the funniest character, a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking characters.<br /><br />******* and ****** are respectively master and pooch. As the human half of the duo, ******* is a homily looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things. One of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of chutes, hatches, and spring-operated contraptions that dress and feed them. Meanwhile, ****** is the animal half. The running joke is that ****** shows more common sense than his genius of a master. As good as his ideas and inventions are, ******* could not succeed without the loyal ****** giving him a hand. Our heroes run a pest protection business called 'Anti-Pesto.' Essentially, they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a Bun-Van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container. No, ******* and ****** don't kill the critters. Instead, they keep them as pets, and ******* experiments with an inventionÂ—Mind-O-Matic--designed to convert hares into carrot-haters. This "Frankenstein" meets "The Fly" approach plunges poor ******* into deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with that of a rabbit. Not long thereafter, a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village's 517th annual Vegetable Contest approaches.<br /><br />Initially, ******* and ****** appeared in ****'s Oscar-nominated, film school project "A Grand Day Out" (1989). Since then ******* has released ten other animated shorts, among them "******* and ******: A Close Shave" (1993) and the Oscar-winning ******* and ******: The Wrong Trousers" (1995). "Curse of the Were-Rabbit" differs not only because it represents the duo's big-screen debut, but also it runs a whopping 85 minutes. The first two-thirds of "Were-Rabbit" contain better gags than the last third, but **** and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids won't get but attentive grown-ups will appreciate. "******* and ******: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" is hare-raising fun.
