****'s favourite from the first run of Season 10 and also one of my personal favourites, ********** features the adventure of ** **** before going on global warming and before the movie, it was similar a adventure certainly, ** **** was also trying to aware the world about something that can change the Earth, something really dangerous, this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig, ** **** had only one thing in mind: to aware everyone of ********** and to kill it! ** **** here is more than hilarious, everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish, doing tantrums since nobody believes him but he is just a f****** demented bastard. Basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of ** **** but certainly he don't have that in his mind, there's not space for any other subject, is just ********** what concerns ** ****. Those four kids are *******, *****, **** and ****, basically **** felt sorry for AL **** and the four boys were just playing in ** ****'s game never imaging that **** could almost kill them while he was trying to kill ********** (hilarious scene- "they are just children, damned **********"). So at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for ** **** and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious ******* episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of ******* after he finds a treasure inside the cave, certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick ******* in both senses, he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us. And in the end ** **** does killed **********! This character is a fantastic one and I'm cereal! Terrific fun in this episode, a highly re-watchable one. 10 out of 10
