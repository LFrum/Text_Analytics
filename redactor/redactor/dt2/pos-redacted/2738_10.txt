During the brief Golden Age of the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home Movies, we purchased a GAF Projector for $148.00 on close-out at a Downtown Chicago Camera Store. It seemed that GAF was getting out of the Camera & Projector Business; although they would continue with their other enterprises, such as the former Sawyer's Vue-****** 3 Dimensional color slide viewers.<br /><br />Little did we know nor anticipate the rapid approach of the Video Camera, the Betamax, the VHS and the eventual DVD revolutions. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera that we also purchased, we took some sound film records as our Daughter, ****'s First **** ********* and her younger Sister, ********'s Graduation from Pre-School. This was all circa 1979-82.<br /><br />During this time we also purchased a few ***** **** to go with it; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sound LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. FIELDS' Shorts from ********* *****, *********, Iowa. We also picked up a Columbia Pictures Home Movies Sound Film of a then sort of forgotten ******* *******, UPA's GERALD McBOING-BOING (****** *********** of America/Columbia, 1951). It was THE hit of our Home Movies Time! <br /><br />Being members of that **** ****** **********, the Wife (Deanna) and meself had recollection of the Character of ****** McBoing-Boing; for ****** had a ******* TV Show on CBS, early Sunday Evenings, ca. 1955. **** ******* was the Announcer/Host. But we had never seen this original UPA Theatrical Cartoon; nor was it known to us that the young ****** McBoing-Boing was a creation of Dr. Seuss of "Grinch", "******" and "******** ******" fame.<br /><br />THE staff assembled was very talent rich and deep. The outstanding production values are apparent. Director ****** ****** and Supervisoring Director **** ****** were veterans at the top of their craft. Writers were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, Himself), **** ******* and **** Scott.<br /><br />Mr. Scott is remembered not so much for his writing contributions to UPA, but for being partners with *** **** in such Television Properties as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, *** *******, FRACTURED FLICKERS, GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE, HOPPITY HOOPER and FRACTURED FLICKERS. With the *** **** Productions he was a writer, voice man and Kibitzer-General of the whole company.<br /><br />The cartoon receives its only "voice" from the Narrator, Radio/Movie/TV Actor ****** ******. Remember him? He was ******* ******* on the TV Ssries THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions/CBS Television *******, 1955-60).<br /><br />Bold color schematic and imaginative design went into giving the UPA animations a special feelings of loneliness, fear apprehension and eventual triumph. And, we might add, the animation is definitely of the "Limited" Variety.<br /><br />AS with so many great stories, ours starts out with a simple premise; one's being born different. In this case it is young boy ****** ******, who has been born to make sound effects in communicating rather than talking. Kids can be cruel and soon he is dubbed with his not so flattering nick name by a group of youthful taunters chanting: "Nya, nya, your name's not McCloy; it's ****** McBoing-Boing, the Noise Making Boy!" AT this point, the Animation Team does an outstanding job in shifting the emotional gears in the young outcast from happy & carefree to isolated & lonely and finally to depression & despair in not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding; not even to his Mother and Father.<br /><br />A frighteningly fashioned dark scene involving a highly UPA stylized run away scene involving a Train and an equally stylized Snowfall brings ****** right to the brink of absolute despair. But then, he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young ****** is wanted by the producer of some Radio Program to provide the sounds for the show down at the Studio.<br /><br />ONCE the premiere show is done with ****** starring in the Sound Department, he rides off in a huge Limousine (which seems to have anticipated those S-t-r-e-t-c-h Limos of our day) to the cheers and admiration of his Classmates and the World.<br /><br />IT has been said that there are only so many plots and, in that case this story is most likely a variation on The Ugly Duckling; for after all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness.<br /><br />NOTE: ****** *********** of America, or UPA for short, was an outstanding center of creativity in the field of the Animated Cartoon. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several sequels and a TV ******, but also the highly popular *** ***** ********** ******** and subsequent TV Show (with voice talent of *** ******), the Classic Original TV Cartoon of FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and the rather bizarre DICK TRACY ******* **** (with *****'s voice rendered by *** ******* ******!).
