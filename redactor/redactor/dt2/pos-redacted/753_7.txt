***** ********* *****(the lovely ***** *******)has arrived to Dr. ********' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job. What she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after ******** is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal "judge" ****** * *******(..in a running gag, anytime he confronts a situation out of his control, he retreats to repeating his name). That doctor is ********* *******(********* *******)who isn't sure about whether ***** is a proper fit for their establishment. After a long discussion about the position(which is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about *****'s being sent a letter by ******** getting a job at the clinic with ******* often reminding her that he is no longer in charge)******* agrees to let her work in the nursing position, but the good Doctor may not be who she seems..<br /><br />The assortment of loonies includes Sam(**** *****)a simple-minded child-man who was ********' last victim of lobotomy, Jennifer(********* ******)a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she wallows at *******' heel like a puppy, Danny(****** *****)a trouble-making annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed Harriet(******* ****), Allyson(***** ********)a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and hops at any man she sees, & "Sergeant" Jaffee(Hugh Feagin)your typical case of soldier who hasn't escaped the madness of war.<br /><br />The film shows *******' unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without locks calling into question..and, not to mention, the fact that ****** is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping Dr. ******** with an axe. And, what exactly happened to Dr. ********? Ah ha..<br /><br />Tacky 70's drive-in trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema. I'm attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable nature..you just never know what the hell might happen, especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended. Some consider the low budget a liability, but in the case of this film, I think it enhances the experience. With the cheap photography and weak production values(being shot for peanuts in a run down house in some awful location)it seems creepier and I felt like a voyeur peering into insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking in.
