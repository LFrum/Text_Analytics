After seeing this DVD, I was floored. It is SO wonderful. Not only does it capture *** ******** during convented performances, they span a few years. This only shows the growth of the band, and the growth of their GREAT music. This DVD is a MUST HAVE! The DVD is over 5 hours long, with extras. The extras are also great pieces, some are of the band performing in Denmark, and other various promo spots. This contains footage that was once thought lost, thankfully recovered, and carefully restored to 5.1 Dolby Digital, under direct supervision of ***** **** himself! Includes many timeless classics, such as, ******** To Heaven, Going To California, What Is And What ****** Never Be, **** ****, and so many more. Great acoustic songs are also included. This will correct any forethought that ***** **** isn't a supreme guitar legend!
