Many have disparaged ***** *** Never Again because it is not an official **** movie. Nevertheless, it is manifest that the producers adhered to the fruitful **** formula. Although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the commencement of the film is meant to be the introductory scene. It would have been impossible for EON to stop the producers from including a pre-credit and title sequence, albeit without the gun-barrel introduction.<br /><br />**** ******* is on fine form as the immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than Dr No, Thunderball, You Only **** ***** and ******** *** *******. Although, NSNA is meant to be a remake of Thunderball, it is a vast improvement. 007 spends more time on terra firma and a more diverse range of exotic locations are included in the film. <br /><br />There is some resplendent acting in this movie. ******* ******* is impeccable as the bizarre ****** *****. One of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between **** and Fatima in Nice, which is preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city. ***** ***** ********* plays the psychotic Largo and *** *** ***** is free of the melodrama that other actors portraying ******* have indulged in.<br /><br />NSNA tends to centre on Connery rather than the character of ****. At the commencement it is stated that **** is ageing and has been out of action. This seems to refer to the 12 year hiatus in Connery's portrayal of ****. **** promises "never again" to work in the Secret Service; an allusion to Connery's portrayal of ****. It appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official **** franchise. <br /><br />Nevertheless, this film is definitely worth watching. This is the last time that **** ******* played ***** ****, but his performance convinced me that perhaps he should have never have said "never again".
