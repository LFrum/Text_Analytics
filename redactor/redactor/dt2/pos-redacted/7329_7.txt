I was rather appalled to see the low rating this movie received here, personally considering it fun family fare. It revolves around a young teenager, ***** *****, who is sent by his mom to Coral Key to spend the summer with his ***** ******. While there he befriends a dolphin named *******. Lots of adventures ensue amid the predictable nephew / uncle bonding as well as a little romance for ***** with a local girl.<br /><br />I'm a great Crocodile Dundee fan myself so absolutely loved **** ***** in his role as crusty and comical ***** ******. For starters, he keeps an endless stock of Spaghetti-O's in his house to serve as his usual meal, heated with a blowtorch! ***** Wood, ***** from The Lord of the Rings, appeared quite competent playing the young *****, a boy at first none too fond of his forced summer vacation locale.<br /><br />Of course the dolphin is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes. Set in the Florida Keys, it was apparently filmed in the Bahamas. This adaptation of ******* makes great family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental, and fun movie that is infinitely superior to many of the cinematic offerings for youngsters nowadays.
