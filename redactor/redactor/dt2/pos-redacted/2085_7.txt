Zachary ***** does what he does best, i.e., plays a worm, in "****** ******," a 1945 B movie also starring **** *******, **** *******, and ******** ******. ***** plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On the lam from his last murder, he rents a room in the home owned by the Fenchurch family, ***** (*******) and her mother (**** *******). ***** throws himself at *******, and she's dazzled. Mid-romance, her younger sister **** (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. When she mentions that she was ***** ****'s favorite and he left her $25,000 (big bucks by 1945 standards), ***** loses interest in poor ***** and makes a play for ****. **** looks like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking around with ***** - overnight, she ages 10 years and becomes downright nasty to her sister. Finally getting the message that her tenant is no good, ***** calls in a psychiatrist (******** ******) to psyche him out and advise her.<br /><br />Psychological dramas were all the rage during and after World War II, and ***** does an excellent job as a smooth sociopath. This was his forte - as a weak-willed sheriff in "******** ****," he exhibited no real presence. As for two-timing, we saw him do that in "******* ******," where he proved himself particularly good at it. ******* is a bookish stenographer with her hair pushed off her face and her big glasses, but after hours, she's lovely, and gives a strong performance. DeCamp was always an underrated actress - here, she sports a soft German accent and is delightful.<br /><br />This is a highly entertaining film though a very routine story. The acting truly elevates it.
