WWII veterans return home and find it hard to adjust to civilian life. This superb drama is expertly directed by ***** and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer Toland. Despite its near three-hour length, it does not drag for a minute. The script by Sherwood features very human characters and great dialog. ******* has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Also good are ****** as a love-sick young woman, **** as *******' trampy wife, and real-life veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands. However, top honors go to ***** and *** as a long-married couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other.
