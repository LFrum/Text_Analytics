This is a thoughtful film that lays bare the inequities of the so-called upper class and those who work for them, the haves and have-nots. ****** **** does a creditable job in his role as the obliging, correct chauffeur, ****** *********, who helps **** ******** (***** *****) overcome her mental depression at the outset. However, ****** has many mixed feelings regarding this lady of the upper class. He inevitably falls in love with her, which of course is overstepping the societal boundaries that separate them.<br /><br />I have not read anything prior to this and only judge the movie as I have seen it. I consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily living and the conflict of what we might wish or expect from life and what we get. It's a fine drama worth seeing again.
