forget the over-rated "****** ******, THIS is the ultimate ****** movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on. this movie has everything, and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office, but this is certainly a much better film. the visuals are amazing, Burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again. Gotham city, ******s hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold. the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are VERY interesting, much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts. *** Burton and screenplay writer ****** ******* go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters. the Penguin, played to perfection by ***** ******, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him. very disgusting to watch at times, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film. the other villain is ********, played so absolutely brilliantly by ******** ********, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a WOW performance, and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain's is concerned. she also has a tragic background. her name is Selina kyle, and she is a very put-upon, mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called *** ******, who later murders her by shoving her out a window. somehow, she survives and is "awakened" by cats, and decides right then and there to become the legendary ********, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most Oscar worthy performance's of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress.<br /><br />******* ****** once again dons the cape and cowl as ****** and also as ***** ***** and THIS time hes much darker. there's not much else to say here except that ****** is simply the best actor to play ****** ever. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of ***** ******** approach to playing ******, and he is very dark. he doesn't talk a lot, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound all goofy and fake IE bales "batman" voice in batman begins. he struts around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he's pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world.<br /><br />i have to say though, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest ********* EVER racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across Gotham, its the romantic angle between ******** and ****** that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL ****** in action, i rate this a 10, would give it more if i could.
