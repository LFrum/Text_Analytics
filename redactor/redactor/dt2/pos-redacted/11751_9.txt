Directed by a veteran Hollywood director ***** King who began his career still in 1915, **** is a Many Splendored Thing was one of his last great films. It was based on a bestseller by *** ***** called simply A Many Splendored Thing the phrase that was borrowed by the author from the poem The Kingdom of God by ******* ******** where that many splendored word `love' was used in quite a different and rather transcendental context meaning the love of God. Made in the Â‘50s, the film marked along with works by such directors as ******* **** and ******** ******** a sort of renascence of melodrama, its florescence and reaching yet again a peak of popularity. <br /><br /> The story begins when a handsome American reporter **** ******* played by ******* ****** yet once again typecast in one of his irresistible `playboy' roles comes to the Hong Kong and meets there a young and pretty *** ***** (******** *****) of half-Chinese half-English origin who is working as a doctor at a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the Chinese communists. Instantly **** feels a rather strong attraction towards her but at the beginning his deep feelings are not quite reciprocated by ***'s heart left cold after the death of her husband (`I believe in human heart now only as a doctor'). But very soon she yields to the persistent courting of tempting as hell **** and both of them enter a passionate relationship apparently stoppable by nothing, even by the fact that **** is unhappily married and his wife doesn't want to give him a divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by ***'s Chinese origin. But still it's the fate that has a final word to say in determining the fairness of the eternalness of such a blissful loving relationship for no matter how enduring the two assume it to be the merciless time is waiting in a rather alarming form of death, prepared at any given moment to prove its impermanence.<br /><br /> Undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made, **** is a Many Splendored Thing features fine performances from ******* ****** and ******** *****, wonderful ******* ***** winning musical score by ****** ****** and extremely romantic, touching, heart-warming but ultimately heart-breaking story. Don't miss that many splendored film. 8/10<br /><br />
