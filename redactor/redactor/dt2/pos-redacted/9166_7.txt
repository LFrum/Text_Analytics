This movie was much better than I expected. After a couple of films by **** ***** that weren't that great like I, *****, he is back to being likable and fun in this one. Smith plays, *****, a date doctor. Most of the film centers around him teaching ****** how to be himself and get a date with ******* ****, a rich famous celebrity whom he works with. ****** is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what-not. All ***** does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around *******.<br /><br />During all this, ***** meets ****, a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men. ***** charms her, so of course, they go out. But, ***** may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them, he doesn't believe in love himself. He has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. But, he likes ****, so keeps going after her. ****'s friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor. So **** tracks the doctor down, only to learn its *****. So of course, she thinks he's a pig. Then it's up to hitch to explain to **** and ******* what he does, so they both end up forgiving.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Good, has some laughs, and is entertaining. I recommend it.
