This film is one of my fondest childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading *********, singing and dancing, with **** ***** googely-eying her beloved ******, ****** **** doing his best as everyone's manager, and a generous cast of "extras" delivering a film that turned out to be "okey dokey".<br /><br />******'s melancholy ukulele number "******* **********" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was beat out by ***** ***'s "It Goes Like It Goes". I'll pick ******'s song any day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy...someday they'll find it, the rainbow connections, the lovers, the dreamers and me!
