Disney's ***** ***** ******** presents a wonderfully told fact-based sports drama directed by actor **** ******. Photography is superb, but story sometimes lumbers along. This film is about the 20 year old amateur golfer ******* ******(Shia LaBeouf)and his competition in the 1913 U.S. Open. What a story; a once-in-a-lifetime chance for a supposedly incapable young man to play along side the best golfers of the time, including British champions ***** ******(******* *******)and Ted Ray(******* ******). A storybook ending leaves a knot in the throat. The cast also includes: ***** *****, ***** ******, ****** *******, ***** ******, and possibly stealing the show is **** *******, who plays ***** ******, ******'s caddy and best friend.
