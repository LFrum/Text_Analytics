*******, a young teacher in the island of Elba, has been formed by ******* **********, an excellent educator, to be his own man and to say whatever he thinks, something that gets him in trouble at the school where we first meet him because he is teaching revolutionary ideals. The island is in a frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in European history of the 19th century. ******** is coming to his exile, not exactly a high point in his life.<br /><br />With surprise, ******* is chosen to accompany ******** who is writing his memoirs and is in need of help for his own project. The young man comes from a sea merchant family. His brother and sister want him to go on an commercial expedition, but ******* has decided his place belongs in Elba because he will try to assassinate ********. Little deters him after his mentor ********** is tried for treason and condemned to be shot by a firing squad.<br /><br />******* finds his consolation with the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the deposed emperor, a different kind of man emerges. ******** is seen as a more human person who really enjoys the company of *******, not suspecting with the plans the young man's own plans for him. Unfortunately, ******* is not able to put his design into action because ******** has other plans in mind.<br /><br />***** *****, the director of "Caterina va in citta", shows why his early promise is still there. ** * ***** also collaborated with the screenplay, which is based on a novel by ******* *******. The director shows he is as good in intimate drama as well as with this type of spectacle. ********** Pesci, the cinematographer, does an excellent job with the images he was able to get.<br /><br />Elio Germano, a young Italian actor is the best thing in the movie. He is playing against more experienced players, yet he manages to convince us he is the idealist youth trying to get justice to what he perceives is a noble cause. The great ****** ******* is a more subdued ******** than one would expect from anyone's interpretation of this larger than life man. ****** Belucci is the love interest of *******, but she has little to do. ***** ********* plays **********.
