Cult film-maker ********'s rarest of his thirteen ********* ******** (of which I'm only left with WHAT AM I DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REVOLUTION [1972] to catch) is one I only became aware of fairly recently via ***** ******'s "Stracult" guide; it's an atypically bleak genre gem in the style of the director's own masterpiece, THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), complete with desolate snowy landscapes.<br /><br />****** Hallyday, the French ***** *******, whom I first saw in Jean-Luc ******'s DETECTIVE (1985) is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner anti-hero Hud (who, like ***** ********'s The Man With No Name from ****** *****'s celebrated "******* *******", is fitted with a steel-plate armor for protection); incidentally, I had 'met' Hallyday's stunning daughter ***** **** at the 2004 Venice Film Festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director, ****** *******! ******* Moschin is another curious addition to the fold (serving pretty much the same function that ***** ***** did in THE GREAT SILENCE) but acquits himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bathing ********* ******; the latter, then, plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a banker's widow who seduces all and sundry in the pursuit of her goals. ****** ****** has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by Hallyday and who, at one point, is entreated into **** **** by 'hippie' ****** ********* ********* (with this is mind, it's worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome bouts of nudity from both Fabian and Tavernese)! Incidentally, the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long-haired youths (who also engage in dope-smoking and revolutionary talk) is a somewhat half-baked attempt at contemporary relevance  but it all eventually adds to the fun (besides, even the black barmaid sports an Afro hairdo!).<br /><br />***** *****, too, enjoys himself tremendously with the smallish role of a larger-than-life Mexican bandit nicknamed "El Diablo"  who keeps a youthful biographer constantly by his side (an element which may have influenced ***** ********'s UNFORGIVEN [1992]) and, at one point, challenges the captive Moschin to a head-butting duel! Having mentioned this, the film also contains one very unusual 'weapon of death'  as Hallyday disposes of an adversary by kicking the cash-register of the saloon into his face! As always, the enjoyably fake fistfights are accompanied by over-emphatic sound effects; equally typically for the genre, however, the wistful score by ****** ********* ********* emerges a most significant asset. Actually, the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the film's generally somber tone  after Fabian's comeuppance at the hands of the locals, the hippies (who had previously idolized Hud) suddenly turn against him when wounded and terrorize the town (forcing everyone on the street and unclothed)but the unflappable gunman manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge (they, however, scurry away at the prospect of facing him!) and then rides out of town, leaving ****** behind.<br /><br />In conclusion, I acquired this via a good-quality Widescreen print in Italian albeit with French credits and the occasional lapse  about one minute of screen-time in all  into the French language (where, apparently, the original soundtrack wasn't available).
