I first saw this film in the mid 60's when I was a teenager, and it moved me so much, in fact the end scene where *** ***** hears of ****'s death, and then rushes to the hill in disbelief, where you then hear ****'s voice saying "Give ** **** ****", and then the image of him disappears, the butterfly with it's superstitious meaning, the music, the shattered emotions of Love of *** *****, just left me sobbing my heart out. I was outwardly crying bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction. I just left the room to be on my own. Fortunately I do not react like that any more BUT I always cry at the end. I love everything about the film, the music mostly, the costumes of *** *****, and location. The beauty of ******** ***** and the handsome ******* ******, they were both at their best. I have the VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of the Music & ****** by ****** ****** and ***** ****. I also have the book A Many Splendored Thing by *** *****. I recommend this film 100%
