**** ******** (**** **********) is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn't leave his wife, he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide. Too bad for him our rumpled detective, Lt. ******* (***** ****), is on the case.<br /><br />******* ****** has written another razor-sharp episode for the series, following marvelous detail with marvelous detail. We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we're completely engrossed. Then when ******* appears on the scene, it gets even better.<br /><br />We first see ******* after the murder (as per usual). This time he's at the vet with his new dog. Scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show (think *******'s discomfort over the nude model in "Suitable for Framing"). ******* is hilarious when he's dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry; but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he's with non-suspects. Bochco, by contrast, shows ******* a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story. (And I'm grateful he didn't strain for a punchline to *******'s quest to give the dog a name. As far as we learn, the dog remains nameless.) Bochco gives ******* some of his best moments in this episode, and ***** **** makes the most of them. He's particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself, much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And he's even better in his scenes playing cat-and-mouse with **********. That these two long-time friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected; and that's what we get. Notice how **** ******** can't help but admire the deceptively dimwitted *******, even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck.<br /><br />Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script. When ******* goes to question ********'s snooty mechanic, of course  of course!  he asks the man to look at his own beat-up heap. And when ******** finds ******* at the Hollywood Bowl before rehearsal, of course  of course!  he's on the piano playing "Chopsticks." And what should our audacious lieutenant bring with him but the victim's typewriter with the phony suicide note still in the roller.<br /><br />******* also has good scenes with a precocious little girl (Dawn Frame) and the lovely ****** ******, who plays **********'s wife. It's nice to see ***** *** show up as ******'s mother, though she does little with her minor role.<br /><br />The director ******** ********* (who also acted, most notably as Coach in "Cheers") does a perfectly creditable job, though he follows the lead of nearly every other "*******" director by adding one or two silly flourishes. Scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus. Then there's that bit where ********** sees the carnation he dropped at the scene of the crime  and we see a zoom-in shot of it reflected in his sunglasses. There's also one scene with ***** *** and group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except **********.<br /><br />These are quibbles, though. This is a splendidly entertaining episode, the kind that made me a "*******" fan.
