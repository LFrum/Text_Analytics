At first glance of this mini... I was a bit disappointed that ***** *** ***** and Anjelica Huston didn't return to the cast. Both **** ****** and ******* ******* did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary Epic Western. <br /><br />Cherokee **** ******* (Haysbert) played an excellent bad guy, and ***** ******* Jr. was, as always, true to form with his excellent acting skills.<br /><br />The drama that seemed true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, where the valiant shoot-out ended with ****** ****** being killed made me feel that I was actually in the film. Return to ******** **** was to me, almost up to the quality of the first of the series. The next 2 follow ups with ***** ****** as Call just didn't make it for me. And that Lorena marries *** ***? How the heck did that get in their? That was a total mismatch of characters. The first 2 of the series made the Epic story, the next 2 in no way were of the same quality.<br /><br />Now, if the first 2 could be remastered in Dolby Digital and an Anamorphic presentation, the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today.
