True, this is not **** ****** finest film (******* **** ******* ******) but it is not entirely forgettable either, if not for any other reason than its message. Like ******, **** *****'s parents were murdered in front of him, leaving him to fend for himself in 'The Zone,' a corrupt section of an unnamed city where greed and violence reign supreme. Instead of falling in with the likes of Chopper (****** ****) **** ***** fights for justice, using his powers of *** *** and eerie cat impressions, occasionally lighting himself on fire. He becomes something of an urban legend, a modern day ***** ****, and a hero for the ages. 1987 at its finest, WILD THING LIVES
