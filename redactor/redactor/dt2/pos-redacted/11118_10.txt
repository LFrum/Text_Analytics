This movie tells the story of nine ambitious teens trying to follow their dream at the infamous New York High School For Performing Arts: ****, the singer, *****, the modern Mozart, ****, *****, and ******, the struggling dancers, *****, the comedian, and ***** and Montgomery, the actors. While they all think they have what it takes to really reach their goals, they are going to need a lot more than just their talent. They will have to deal with rejection, heartbreak, education, pain, and love in order to achieve their fame.<br /><br />"Fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic, and inspirational movies of all time. It has everything a teen drama/musical should have: extremely catchy, entertaining, Oscar-winning songs performed by the amazing ***** ****, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters, and a great story, including the heartbreaking scene when **** meets the video camera.<br /><br />Like I said, the cast is awesome. ***** **** can really act, and it's not only her singing that makes her shine here as ****. *** ******* is very good as *****. ***** ****** brings a lot of humor to *****. ******* Teefy is great as the outcast *****, and look closely, and you'll see **** ******* of "ER" as Montgomery.<br /><br />This is truly an amazing film. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to keep following my dreams as an actor and singer. Any movie that moves me this much is a winner in my book. A must-see! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
