****** ********, ******* Day and **** **** star in "And One Was Beautiful," a 1940 film also starring ****** *****. At one hour and 15 minutes, this looks to have been a B movie. Cummings is a playboy, ****** *****, whom many women desire, including two sisters, ********* and ***** ******* (Day and Muir). ********* is the more earthbound of the two who likes to fix cars, and ***** is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gowns. ****** arrives back in town, and, believing he's not going to be at a party, ***** decides not to attend. Since the party is given by a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends ********* in a pinned up dress. ****** is there, and the two connect. But ****** is into more superficiality, and when he sees ***** at a dinner party, the two pick up where they left off and go to a club. He becomes terribly drunk, and ***** at first refuses to ride in his car because he won't let her drive. After walking awhile and breaking the heel of her shoe, she gets into ******'s car when he drives by. He passes out, and she takes over the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a bicyclist.<br /><br />****** can't remember anything, so ***** lets him take the blame for the death. The heel of a woman's shoe is found in the car, and ********* sees her sister bury her shoes - plus, something in *****'s manner makes her realize that ***** isn't telling the truth. ****** is convicted and goes to prison, and ***** marries a man she doesn't love and leaves for South America.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film, even though at the time, this wasn't an A-list cast. Cummings is playing a part that ****** ****** would have played (it's an MGM film) - he's handsome and very amiable, even if he doesn't have the dazzling looks of someone like ******. ******* Day is a favorite actress of mine, someone MGM loaned out constantly because they didn't know what to do with her. Why, I wonder - a wonderful actress with a great face and voice, she livened up many a film. This one is no different. Her ********* is determined, sympathetic and totally lovely. **** **** is a lousy actress.<br /><br />So who was the beautiful one? We all know even if MGM didn't.<br /><br />****** recommended little gem.
