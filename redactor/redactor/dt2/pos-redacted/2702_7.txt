Every time I hear ***** *********'s voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. ******* Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought ***** ***** would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of ***** and ******* but also the personal struggles that ***** dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp ******'s studio are very nicely done. However ***** ********* turned out, there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers. Even if you weren't a Carpenter's fan this is a nice story that depicts how a great talent can fall victim to the pressures of society.
