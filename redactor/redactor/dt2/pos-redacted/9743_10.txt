As previously stated in one of my great reviews, the ********* Pictures'Trilogy of FLASH GORDON should not be classified with the other serials. For,indeed the three of these have made a sort of celluloid-electronic mythology for a punchy, war phobic mid twentieth century world. They stand alone in many peoples' minds as THE example of just what a cliff hanger was.<br /><br />We can recall seeing ****** ******* as a guest on NBC's late night talk show, TOMORROW, hosted by *** ******. This was circa 1979-80. During the interview *** ****** was asked about his personal fitness habits. He credited weight training and swimming, coupled with some sound dietary habits-which included vitamin and protein supplementation.(And would you believe it, he smoked several cigarettes!)<br /><br />When questioned about his career, *** ****** of course got to the subject of his portrayal (and strong identification with) the character of Flash. ****** stated that he had read and enjoyed the feature in its original medium, that is a comic strip the property of Hearst's King ******** *********. He stated that he had thought that it would not work once transferred to the screen! Luckily he was wrong.<br /><br />As for the 1st serial, it was a very good adaption of the original continuity from the Sunday Color Comics. The world is about to end because of impending collision with ****** ********'s up to independent working Dr. ****** to rocket to the wild planet to change its course. He enlists the aid of Flash and **** **** *****, newly acquainted parachuters from airliner, landing in ******'s property.<br /><br />The Serial has excitement through out and manages to make one feel that there is always some other peril lurking just outside the film frame. The costuming and decor is varied,from Romanesque to Oriental to *** *****. It would be easy to surmise that this was due to frugality on the part of *********,but once again this was being faithful to creator,cartoonist **** *******'s visual concepts.(just look at the old strips as reprinted in many collections) The rockets were used before in JUST IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a science fiction musical comedy.The other scientific lab equipment was provided by *********'s prop dept.,being the top Hollywood company doing ****** and SciFi.<br /><br />The cast features **** ******(**** *****) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura)who get into a good girl vs. bad girl battle over Flash. ******* ********* portrays ******* **** in a sort of overly melodramatic villain,but makes it work. ******(***** *******)is toned down from the sheer madness that he suffered in his appearance in newsprint. (by the way, ever wonder how ******* has a brogue?) ******* ********* makes a fine, powerfully built ****** *****, ever helpful and so noble.<br /><br />Comic actor **** "Tiny" ****** is the surprise of the cast, stealing scene after scene as a lecherous, ***** **** like scoundrel turned ally, King Vultan,ruler of the Hawkmen. Among the others, most notable is *** ****** as Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Pierce,like ******, had also portrayed ****** in a film-but he later married ****** *******, ***** **** **********' daughter, Joan.<br /><br />FLASH GORDON and the two sequels, FLASH GORDON's TRIP TO MARS(1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE(1940), have been a staple juvenile fare for generations,first in the movie houses then in Television release. Like fine wine, they seen to get better with age.<br /><br />We're all so glad that ********* was wrong.
