THE GREEN BUTCHERS (Anders Thomas ****** - Denmark 2003).<br /><br />How do the Danes keep coming up with these films that are consistently funny, sharply written, exquisitely filmed and filled with great performances? THE GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark and wickedly funny comedy, in many ways the Danish counterpart of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it has more on offer than just laughs or parody. <br /><br />The film brings us the duo of chronic pothead ****** (******* *** ****) and chronic perspirer ***** (**** *********). Sick of their evil boss, the two pals decide to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town, but initially business is slow and customers stay away. When an electrician is accidentally locked up and freezes in their meat locker, ***** decides to turn the man's thigh into fillets he promptly nicknames "chickie-wickies." This special dish suddenly has everyone in town flocking to their counter and ***** - unable to resist this sudden leap into popularity - turns into a serial killer with ****** acting as his reluctant accomplice. But soon, led by their ex-boss, many people in town are starting to wonder what special ingredients the two men are using.<br /><br />Without the extraordinary performances by **** and *********, the film might not have risen above the level of the average black comedy. On paper, the character of ***** might border on caricature but **** ********* portrait is that of an earnest, insecure and deeply twisted man, but ********* manages to make him frightening, funny and moving at the same time. **** actually plays a double role, also playing his comatose twin brother *****. When watching the film, I never even realized it was the same actor. The other performances are just as wonderful with every character in town refreshingly off-the-hook with some truly wonderful vignettes.<br /><br />The subject material is - naturally - a bit morbid and the material might not be completely fresh, considering quite a few predecessors that handled the same kind of material, but director ****** gives it a fresh twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange duo of ***** and ******, with this wonderfully bizarre tale of two social misfits.<br /><br />****** ******* --- 9/10
