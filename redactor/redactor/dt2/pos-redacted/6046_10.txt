Hey there Army Sgt. I'm sorry dude but being a SGT in the Army and being in the Army National Guard does not make you qualified to comment on a ****** movie. You are not a ****** and just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you can relate to being a ******. We simply are the best, we have the hardest training, yes we have big heads about ourselves, but hey when you are the best, you like to strut your stuff. I was in the Iraq invasion and in Fallujah. I fought next to soldiers. You are not "qualified" to say anything about my ****** *****. I hate to be the one that starts the whole "which branch is better", but you have no right to say you are qualified to judge a ****** movie. Oh yeah......we are Drill Instructors.......not ***** ***'s. That's the biggest clue you have no idea about what you are talking about. Yeah we do not "curse" at recruits anymore. Tell me, how is cussing at someone going to make them a better ******? How will me hitting someone make a ****** a better ******? Yes it is a kinder boot camp from what I went through. But we are dealing with different times and people. We are training people who are over all smarter than our generations recruits. We want smarter recruits, not meaner. And anyone who signs up to be a ****** in the first place, has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer. We don't have to reinforce that in Bootcamp. ******* come to Bootcamp wanting to be killers. We don't need to teach them that by demoralizing them by swearing at them and beating them. At least that is how I feel.And yes, I am "qualified" to say that. I have been on the battlefield numerous times and I have trained ******* and Recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield. But then again, what do I know. I was just there, done that, got the t-shirt. SGT of the Army.......get a clue!
