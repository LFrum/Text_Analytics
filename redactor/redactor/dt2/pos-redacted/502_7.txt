Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. Despite my initial fears **** * carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka ***** provides a formidable physical presence. Lots of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction. IF you like the black look of The Matrix then ***** will appeal to you, ***** even has a 'dodge the bullets' sequence.
