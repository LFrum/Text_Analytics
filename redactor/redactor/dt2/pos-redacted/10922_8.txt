Some movies want to make us think, some want to excite us, some want to exhilarate us. But sometimes, a movie wants only to make us laugh, and "In & Out" certainly succeeds in this department.<br /><br />Indiana high-school teacher ****** ******** (***** *****) is going to be married to fellow teacher Emily Montgomery (**** Cusack) in three days, but the whole town is more excited about the Oscar nomination of former resident ******* ***** (**** ******). But when ******* wins an Oscar for playing a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher, ******, for inspiration. What follows is ****** denying it in an hilarious set of mishaps in a truly screwball fashion.<br /><br />***** ***** is great, exuding gay stereotypes. **** Cusack really has a knack for screwball antics. ****** Reynolds is utterly hilarious as ******'s mother. And *** ******* is also a hoot as the homophobic principal.<br /><br />Gay screenwriter **** ******* really achieves a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that's mostly tolerable to conservative Midwesterners and yet mostly inoffensive to the gay audience. It's not exactly progressive, but it's funny and inoffensive, and definitely a step up from the previous year's "The Birdcage."
