Returning from 20 years in China, a young missionary refuses to become THE CAT'S-PAW for a gang of hometown hoodlums.<br /><br />This movie was a bit of a departure from ****** *****'s previous movies. ****** derived more from dialogue, often rather serious, predominates here, rather than the elaborate sight gags which powered ******'s classics of the past. There are some splendid moments, however, which are pure visual fun, as when ****** attempts to follow a convertible down a crowded street, or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes. There is also the climactic scene, set in a Chinatown basement, in which ****** gleefully jumps unabashedly into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor derives from ******'s refusal to be the patsy of the criminals who've run his hometown for years.<br /><br />And it's quite a collection of crooked politicians & thugs ****** finds himself up against, played by a bevy of fine character actors: ****** *******, *** *********, ***** ********, ***** *******, **** ********, ****** ***** & stuttering ***** ******. **** Una Merkel is on hand as the tobacco stand girl who catches ******'s eye and keeps him intrigued by her no-nonsense outlook on life.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize ****** ** ***** as ******'s missionary father; ******* ****** as an elderly Stockport clergyman; and ****** **** as a German gangster--all uncredited. Also, showing up for only a few seconds as an attempted kidnapper, is **** *****, a familiar face from ******'s silent films, here making his final appearance in a Lloyd picture.<br /><br />*** gave the film fine production values, especially in the opening scenes set in China.
