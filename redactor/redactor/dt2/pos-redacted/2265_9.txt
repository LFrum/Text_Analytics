SPOILERS A Jewish *****? Yep, that'll be ****** **** again.<br /><br />Ever since the concluding part of "Lord of the Rings", ****** **** as ***** has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role. Playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American, **** has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. Now, with "Everything Is Illuminated" he might finally have achieved this. Playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts, he truly gets to the soul of his character. Still, it isn't like **** does this alone. Aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time directer **** ********* and a wonderful performance by newcomer ****** ****, **** has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "Everything is Illuminated" is a magnificent, moving piece of cinema.<br /><br />******** ****** **** (****), a young American Jew, sets out to the Ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to America. Arriving in the country, ******** meets the all talking, all dancing **** (****) and his racist grandfather (***** ******). Travelling across the country, the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that **** and ******** never knew existed.<br /><br />It's a strange feeling when the film progresses into it's second chapter (it is actually divided into four overall). The first part, whilst occasionally a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. So when we are given a brief history of **** and his family in the second part, to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step. It doesn't quite work, but as the film progresses, it definitely learns it's lesson as this mix of humour and sadness merges finer as time passes.<br /><br />To the ultimate credit of everyone involved, as the story does continue, so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more. ****** **** is magnificent, ***** ****** is so intense and strong that it raises questions why ********* has never properly noticed him. Most notable of all however is newcomer ****** ****. Playing an intensely troubled character, **** is absolutely brilliant. He shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character is communicating with ****, you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level. Without ****, the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent, but with him, it hits the next level.<br /><br />As a debut work for actor turned director **** *********, the story is also a brilliant piece to start. A work of passion (*********'s grandfather himself an immigrant to America), he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content, and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots, he manages to really hit home. The final half hour in particular is so beautifully created, that it's a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye. It is a moving story, and with *********'s help, it becomes even more powerful.<br /><br />Constructed with love from a passionate director, "Everything is Illuminated" is a beautiful piece. A road story with a difference, it is magnificently acted and wonderfully written. It's a film that everyone should see, and it is the perfect way for ****** **** to finally lay ***** to rest.
