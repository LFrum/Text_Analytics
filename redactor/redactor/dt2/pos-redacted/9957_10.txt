There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of ***********'s "The Merchant of Venice," and there have been several television productions. But no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now. Given the nature of the play/s most memorable character, ******* the Nasty Jew, it's a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in Europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have dampened filmmakers' enthusiasm. Sure the main motivation for ******* *******'s new film is to provide ** ****** with a chance to shout, bray, brood, mutter, and be tormented - all of which he is quite good at. Like ******* ***, the role of ******* is a scenery-chewer's dream. It is ridiculous to call *********** an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. **** were banned from England from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death; and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. On some level, **** might as well have been a mythological race to him. But, while *********** may not have been anti-Semitic, his play certainly is. Pacino gives ******* a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of ****** ****. Radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of **** and then spot Antonio (****** *****) gratuitiously spitting on ******* (Pacino), who's really just standing around, minding his own business. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! ***** ******
