I am surprised that this, well above average 80's comedy scores only a 5.2 from all the IMDB voters. *** ******* does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician. He retreats to California to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous Dr Lawrence Baird. The only person that knows he's an imposter is the drunken priest (****** *******) who comes along to be pampered by *******'s new found wealth having blakmailed him. ******* Grodin throws in a good supporting performance too. For its genre I think this film deserves the same crediblity as 'Ferris *******' or 'Trading ******'. 7.5 / 10
