If we consider three films with a similar subject, which are this one, which was made in 1930, 'The ******* *****', made in 1923 and '***** ******' made in 1950, the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'The ******* *****' is only 7 years whereas the distance between 'The Big Trail' and '***** ******' is 20 years. This is amazing because it shows how much movies evolved in those 7 years, and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to come. 'The Big Trail is technically close to '***** ******', but ages apart from 'The ******* *****'. The story is about the pioneers going from the Missouri to the west in Oregon. ****** ***** Sr. is the man leading the caravan, he is a rough and mean guy. **** ***** is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks, not giving him a chance to be the ***** that we are used to. Marguerite ********* is such a proud lady that you wonder why ***** just does not forget her. ***** ***** was a master at showing caravans and cattle moving through the west, he directed 'The Tall Men' in 1955, which has a lot in common with 'The Big Trail'.
