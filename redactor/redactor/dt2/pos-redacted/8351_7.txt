*minor spoilers*<br /><br />You know, it's getting to the point where **** ****** ********** ********* might just as well be called **** ****** ****** *********. These sequels range from excellent ("Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" and the fantastic "Lion King II: *****'s Pride") to horrible ("The Return of Jafar"). (This is, of course, my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel. "*****'s adventure," and while it is flawed, it is still entertaining.<br /><br />The quality of animation is not up to par with ****** ******* *********; still, the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and ***** have not aged a day since 1955. Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and "Ol' Reliable," and **** still gives him grief about it. There's a nice fight between ***** and a huge dog in the dog pound, and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads (though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor.)<br /><br />I really don't care for most of the songs (though ***** **** and ***** ****--the singing voices of ***** and *****--sing their parts very nicely). Both ******* ********** and ****** ****** have done much better work in the past. ***** *****'s score is okay, but nothing memorable. And some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage; that is, they really don't do much.<br /><br />The voice work, on the other hand, is quite good. While I don't like **** ******* as the dogcatcher, he is very good as *****. ***** Palminteri does a nice job as ******, leader of the junkyard gang, and ****** ****** gives what may be her best performance as *****. Then there is ***** (who is the spitting image of his dad). He is voiced to PERFECTION by ***** ****. Wolf does a superb job of showing *****'s wild streak and his soft side.<br /><br />All in all, while "*****'s Adventure" is flawed, it still makes for rather entertaining viewing. It is my hope, however, that **** ****** ********** ********* will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases.<br /><br />
