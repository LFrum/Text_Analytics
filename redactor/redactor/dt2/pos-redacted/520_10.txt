***** ***** has been acting for forty years now, and while she will never escape the part of ***** ******* in "The Exorcist", few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as "Witchery" does. She plays **** ******, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (********* ******** and **** **********) and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer (***** **********) and his writer girlfriend (****** *******) who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch (********* ****). It seems that a long-ago witch-hunt resulted in her suicide, and she was with child at the time. Unaware of the danger, **** has recently dreamt of the witch's dramatic death, and ****'s little brother ***** (******* **********) has been more directly visited by her spooky, black-clad spirit, which he calls 'the lady in black'. The group's time at the island inn begins quietly enough; unknown to them, however, the Lady in ***** has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat (****** *******). Before long, the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone, and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the Lady in ***** begins her reign of terror. She plans to avenge her own fate by possessing **** and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse - greed, lust, and the blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, she haunts them one by one in gruesome, horrifying ways. The island location is effectively scary, and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot. It's such a colorful film that it reminds me of ***** *******'s work. The lighting is excellent, and the set decoration is perfectly spooky. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extreme, terrifying, and unforgettable. The cinematography is great, and it is this that brings us back to ***** *****. The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot: lots of dramatic push-ins, lingering close-ups that subtly detail ****'s incremental possession, and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films. There are hidden homages to "********'s ****", "*****'s Ladder", "The Shining", "***** Sunday", and of course "The Exorcist". She does a great job, and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance. That isn't to say that the rest of the cast disappoints; ********* ******** is sexy and very good, and veteran performer ***** **** is memorable as ****'s bitchy mother ****. Hasselhoff gives it his best, but he is not essentially a film star, and his television persona gets in the way of his performance. ***** and young ******* ********** have a wonderful chemistry together. The film is otherwise so violent and creepy (in a good way) that it desperately needs their warmth (***** also played a mother in 2003's "Monster Makers", and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them). Lastly, ********* **** (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch, and she has the most amazing voice and accent. Along with *****, she was also perfectly cast. But it's *****'s movie all the way. **** ****** also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the film hearkens back to "******** **: The Heretic". I think "Witchery" is up there with "The Exorcist", "******** **", "Hell Night", and "Summer of Fear" as *****'s best genre work to date.
