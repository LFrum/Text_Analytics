This was the best movie ever has seen on "Germen's **** ****" (****** *****) This movie is a realistic critic of the society of the past and the next century. It cause a very good impression to all the partners of "Germen's **** ****". I recommend this movie to all the fans of Troma and to all the people who like the good movies, not the commercial movies.
