This is one of the best TV movies I have ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on, all TV movies are like that!<br /><br />The story is fantastic. It may seem ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story. **** **** plays a military man named **** who feels trapped in his marriage. He abandons his wife and kids and then fakes his death! All so he could be with ****** (***** ******). How far will **** go to keep his secret? <br /><br />The acting is top notch for TV movies. **** **** especially keeps the movie together as a charming, smooth-talking sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious. ***** ****** does the best she can as a wife who discovers that her husband is a LIAR and doesn't know what to do about it. ***** Siddall, who I believe is **** ****'s wife in real life, plays her part well especially when she cries about the "death" of her husband. ***** ******* adds a nice touch as ******'s sister. ***** ******** is great in her small role as ****'s mother.<br /><br />Predictable but the acting and the story take this movie up several notches.
