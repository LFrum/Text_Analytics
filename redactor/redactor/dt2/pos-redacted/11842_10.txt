I hope ****** ******* continues to make more films like this. *********'s books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the Southwest his stories hit home! **** ***** is a highly under rated and under used actor. Wake up *********, not everyone thinks that your Mel ******'s are cool! Many movie goer's today want to see films that make you think. I have seen all of the Redford/********* series. They are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. I'm hoping that if enough people write to ****** ******* he may decide to make a few more! Thank you **** ***** and **** ********* for great entertainment! If anyone get's a chance to read **** *********'s latest book do so! It's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, **** and Colorado. Stop at every view site and feel the setting of *********'s books. Amazing experience.
