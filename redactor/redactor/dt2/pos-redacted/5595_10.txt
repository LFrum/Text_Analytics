****** Silence or "**** ******* ****"1998): Starring ****** ********, ******* ********, ***** *******, ***** ***** ****, ***** *******, ***** **********, ******* ******, *** *******, ***** *****, ***** ******...Director ****** *******, ********** **** ******, **** ******, ******* Murphy.<br /><br />This is another Lifetime channel film, made exclusively for television, released in 1998, directed by long-time TV series director ****** ** *******. Inspired by true events, it's a lot like the majority of Lifetime movies, a cautionary tale for women, raising awareness of the predator lurking within the family (a mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case track coach). The young and little known actress ****** ******** (she played the small girl in Jurassic Park)delivers a highly convincing performance as high school track athlete ****** *******, who is raped by her coach, **** ***** (******* ********) and must suffer in silence as no one believes her story, except for, of course, her own mother (***** *******). Together, mother and daughter fight to put **** ***** behind bars. The film drags on quite a bit, is ultimately predictable, at times far too melodramatic for the sake of drama itself, but is genuinely powerful in the end. ****** ********' performance is of the daytime soap kind, but she is the strongest in the entire cast. Her facial expressions, body language and overall acting is realistic in terms of how she, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes her coach, is in turn violated by him and must now live with the shame, trauma and further, fight him in court. ******* ******** plays the part with a nasty sort of duplicity, though he is far from subtle. He has abused other star athletes before, who have remained silent and made it to the top, and appears outwardly innocent. ******* ********, a lesser-known actors like the others, has has never done a role like this but but he does a believable and strong performance overall. It's especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy lead actor in everything else he does including some lesser known films and on the soap opera "Guiding *****". The only real problem I had with this film is the manner in which the film is structured. As the film opens, we watch ***** ***** about to rape ******, letting us know right away that this guy is no good. But this makes for weak character development and story. If the first scene had instead been the sequence with the opening credits in which we see ****** running/jogging in the city across a lake, we would have better character development because we don't know that ***** *****, while seemingly interested in the success of his star athlete, is really a nasty piece of work and we would have seen ****** idolizing a person whom she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realizes she was wrong about him. Director ****** ******* is no stranger to drama for TV (*****'s Landing, **** ****, ******* ****, The Outer Limits, **** And *****, ***** ***** ******** and movies like ** ***** *******. In 1996, ******* had directed another Lifetime movie, similar to this, "***** ******* ****" (1996). He manages to convey the gravity of the event. We are genuinely disturbed by the coach lurking around the showers where he rapes his own student. These scenes are graphic and ought to be viewed by mature audiences, but its message is clear: sexual predators and rapists are not always a stranger and can assume different forms, and their preying grounds can even include a high school. This film supports the cause of fighting to prevent violence against women and urges women who have been silent victims to testify and fight so that rapists will cause no further harm to others. Despite other negative reviews, this film does a great job in expressing its message and ought to be given to mothers, daughters, high school students (including both male and female). As bad as rape is, staying silent when it happens is even worse.
