Caught this movie on TV and I watched it again. I said to myself, it's been a long time since I watched this movie, so why not. And once again this movie thrilled me. It is so easy, so watchable and so human that I don't know why some people dislike it. <br /><br />**** ******** shines as ******* (his dance and every move), angel that can hardly be related to this word. He smokes, drinks and he eats like some savage, but he's got big heart. On his way ******* helps all people he meets. ******* Winters (***** *********) in her singing and finding a right man. ***** Quinlan (******* ****) in developing himself as a good and decent man. ******* even helped dear old ***** ******* (**** *********) - that last scene is beautiful when they dance on the street.<br /><br />******** had great help in other actors. ***** ********* is so beautiful and likable, ******* **** is great as usual, late ****** ********** shows his talent. **** ********* and **** **** are also good, but my favorite supporting actor in this movie is *** ******* as the tabloid owner.<br /><br />So we've got here a solid movie about people with a warm story also and attractive cast. Just don't take this movie seriously and I can guarantee you'll have fun.
