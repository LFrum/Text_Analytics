Cleopatra (the delicious ****** ********) is challenged by ***** (***** ******): in order to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for ***** in a period of three months, without any delay. She calls the one-arm architect Numerobis (***** *******) and gives him two options: to be covered by gold if he accomplishes his mission, or become crocodile food if he fails. Numerobis will ask for help to Panoramix (****** ****), Asterix (********* *******) and ****** (******* *********) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very funny, specially the parts where ****** and the Pirates leaded by *** ***** participate. However, the screenwriter and the director should have noted that French is not an universal language as English is. Therefore, the jokes with words (like in Austin Powers movies, for example) does not work well for people strange to French language. French people and persons fluent in French language will certainly like these jokes, but they do not make any sense for me, that do not speak French. My vote is seven.
