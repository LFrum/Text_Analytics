Pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case. It starts off marvelously, but kind of hits a wall at a certain point. We're sure we know what happened, then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red herring pops back up and disappoints. Still, *******'s direction is great, and the acting is quite good. ***** Jouvet, who also co-starred in Marcel Carn√©'s ***** de *****, gives the best performance as the clever detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote *****. Much like that film, the police officer doesn't appear until nearly halfway through, and then he becomes almost the focus of the film. There's also a lot of droll comedy surrounding him (although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist).
