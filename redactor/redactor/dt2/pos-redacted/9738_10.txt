i originally seen the flash ****** serial on PBS,and thought it was fun and awesome,i overlooked the special effects of the rocket ships with sparklers,and the big dragon monster with lobster claws,who cares this is 1936 and it was a serial,so each week they would show a new chapter, buster ****** played flash ****** 3 times,in all 3 serials.then in 1939 he played buck rogers,in 1933 he played Tarzan the fearless.he was a very busy actor.beautiful jean rogers played sexy dale Arden.frank Shannon as professor zarkov,and ******* ********* played the evil ming the merciless.he makes ***** ***** look like a boyscout.the serials were very close to the Alex Raymond comic strip.space travel was just a pipe dream at the time.not to mention ray guns and television.this one stands out as the best serial ever.the sequel flash ******'s trip to mars is 2 chapters longer,the next flash ****** conquers the universe is only 12 chapters.and then there's the natives of mongo..,hawk-men, lion-men,shark-men.the feature version leaves out the shark-men scenes. for the full effect you must see the complete serial.i heard ****** ***** was inspired by flash ****** when he did star wars.flash ****** was from universal studios.and the music on the soundtrack is from many universal movies like bride of Frankenstein,werewolf of London,*******'s daughter,etc;even today flash ****** continues to delight people young and old.10 out of 10.
