This is a family comedy -- in the very best senses of the term. Uncomplicatedly about faith and family, *** *****, with the help of everybody's favorite Grandpa, ****** *****, gets divine help in lifting the O'Moyne's above the would-be vengeance schemes of Goldtooth McCarthy (**** ********). Pure fun.
