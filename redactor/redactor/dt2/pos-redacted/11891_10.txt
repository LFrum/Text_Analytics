I just finished screening ** ******* in Germany. A great film. We look forward to seeing more films from *** ***** in the future. It was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic. The ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel. Seeing a film with great quality truly outlines *****'s serious potential and his adept skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. ***** has impressed many with his triumphant performance in "blood in and blood out" and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control. Something that few film makers can afford.
