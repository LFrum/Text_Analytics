I have seen this film more then once. Actually El ******* was one of the best feature films that I have seen in a great deal of time.<br /><br />There was a big cast ******** *****, **** *******, **** ******, and ****** ***** who really shined like a real star in this part of Kilo.<br /><br />I heard this film was shot for under two million dollars. I have seen films shot for 33 million that cant compare to the quality and production value.<br /><br />****** ***** why are you not getting offers and more film work!!! EXCELLENT JOB!!!!!!!!!! I cant wait to see the sequel, and I hope it has the same action.<br /><br />******** ***** has made a cult classic character with Sabeva.<br /><br />****** ***** moves coolly in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40's and 50's So sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like *** ******* getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show. a great film.<br /><br />GO GO GO KICK SOME BUT IN SALES EL PADRINO!!!
