I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as ********* did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a plot which he re-shot later in his career. Possibly the most amazing thing about it, however, is how faceless the lead characters are. After watching, one remembers ****** ***** as the jovial truck driver, ******* ******'s touching turn as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable traveling ***** **** and of course **** ****** as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow *** ******** as the rather wooden fugitive (compare that bridge jump to ******** ****'s similar stunt in ****** *****' "The Fugitive") and Priscilla Lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards Cummings is never quite believable.<br /><br />The other major support player is, of course, ********* himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. Many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that with lack of technology, to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement.<br /><br />Obviously this film carries an anti-fascist message, made at the time of the Second World War, but being a ********* it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action. Well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.
