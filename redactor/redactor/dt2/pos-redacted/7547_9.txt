The first of five St *******'s films (although the last is usually discounted) was based around artist ****** ******'s schoolgirl characters, and features the wonderful ******** *** in drag as ********* *******, headmistress, as well as her own brother. Much of the humour is dated, yet curiously touching and outrageous in today's PC world - the girls drink, gamble, smoke and are later sold off to rich *****, yet always remain in charge, defeating bureaucrats, police, judges and other establishment figures as they maraud across England. Perhaps because the films have been so regularly seen on TV, St *******s still inspires fancy dress parties and club nights. The films have recurring characters that include PC Ruby Gates (***** ********) and ***** ***** (****** ****). The precursor to the entire series is a charming film called 'The Happiest Days Of Your Life' (1950).
