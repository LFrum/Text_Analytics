While many pass this off as a B movie it is, indeed, a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. *** ******* is great as ***** ****** better known to radio fans as The ***. *** Rutherford is perfect as *****'s fiance ***** *******. ****** Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. I read one account of this movie which states that ******** ******* directed this film, not unless he changed his name to S. ****** *****, who directed all three of the *** movies. This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged. So get over your black and white prejudice if you have one, sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy. This was also ***'s first starring role. Take note during the climax of the reference to ***** ******' War Of the Worlds broadcast.
