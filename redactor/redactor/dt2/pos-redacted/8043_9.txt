Slick, tidy, and well-made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made. Determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as "****** the Jackal", **** **** (****** **********, "Without Limits", "***** *******"), a CIA operative and his Israeli counterpart, Amos (Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi", "**** *****") get a noble Naval officer, ******* ******* (***** *****, "Music of the Heart"), to become ****** and use him in a daring plot to get the KGB to kill the real ******, because he took an offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to ***** here, who embodies himself here (in a dual role). ******** ********* ****** and cinematographer ***** ****** provide another great asset of the film here with Hitchcockian-like suspense and great sights of the world.
