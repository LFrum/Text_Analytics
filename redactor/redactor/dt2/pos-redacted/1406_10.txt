****** is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. ****** displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on West Point and **** ********, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And amazingly touching after ******'s character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new, humility-filled ****** get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against **** and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Great, rousing entertainment by MGM in this ****** formula film, shows ***** at his best. ******* Bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. The handsome-but-goony character would be played by ***** *****, **** *****, **** ****** and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by ****** ******* and ****** ******. West Point is a winner!
