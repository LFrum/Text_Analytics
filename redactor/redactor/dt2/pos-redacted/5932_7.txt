This Royal Rumble basically had the message of wrestling these days. ******* and image are more popular then wrestling ability.<br /><br />HBK vs Edge. Pretty good match. A lot of heat for Edge who was just starting out as a heel again and what better way to go into a match with HBK. It kind of got a little slower at the end then usual. Overall this match gets a 6/10. ********** vs **********. Not a good match. ********** had to carry ********** through this match who seemed to be really lost and screwed up his moves. It did get interesting to see **** **** ******* and a bit later **** come into this match. Overall the fans seemed more interested when this match ended. 2/10 **** ***** vs JBL vs Big Show. This match was slow at first but got pretty good at the end when ***** managed to speed up the match.**** ***** did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match. JBL and Big Show put on a slow match. The ending to this match was bad. Over all this match was a 5/10 mainlly because of **** *****. ***** ***** vs HHH. Good match,surprising heat for ***** ***** who was the face in this match. ***** proved he can go the limit with any top star. This match also marked the first match HHH has wrestled where someone dosn't run down and save him from a loss. Over all this match was about a 6/10.<br /><br />Royal Rumble match was OK. Some surprises. Some not so good surprises. I was kind of upset that **** ***** wasn't given enough time in this match. But over all this match had a guy who I never thought would be pushed so soon. I won't tell ya who wins. I give this match a 8/10
