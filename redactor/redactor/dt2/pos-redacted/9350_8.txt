Film noir at its best. Set in the immediate aftermath of WWII ( 1946), "Crossfire" depicts the good, bad and ugly of that time. ***** Montgomery kills *** because ***'s a Jew and therefore, automatically perceived through *****'s narrow lens, to have been a slacker who got out of fighting the war. ***** doesn't like people like that. The truth is that *** was a soldier too, but the truth is something which disappears when you're feeling right about the ideologies of hate you've been immersed in and the world is full of dirty this and thats, badly in need of your brand of "cleansing".<br /><br />***** is a sadist in winning soldier's clothing. The losers of WWII had more than their share as well hate filled, prejudiced leaders and soldiers as well. Some of them were hung for war crimes, like starting a "war of aggression".<br /><br />This movie got its makers in trouble when that other sadistic cleanser of America, *** ******** got his hearings going in the early 1950s.<br /><br />See "Crossfire", just to see how good an actor ****** **** was. The real ****** **** was no *****. He WAS a great, if underestimated, under used actor.<br /><br />See "Crossfire" and get a taste of the dark side of post-WWII America. See it to get a taste of the good side of late 40s America as well. ****** Mitchim and ****** ***** also play leading roles. Mitchim could have played ****'s role, in fact, he did when he played the psychopath in "Cape Fear".
