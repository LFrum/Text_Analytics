Got back from Morocco then, where my dad was attached to the German embassy, when the film came out in Europe; took all my girlfriends to see it, show them the beauty of the country, where **** had played - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after leaving ***** and before joining ***. Sean Combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in Marrakech recently, the Djema el *** was much wilder in those days than it is now; the Stones went there earlier, Brian recorded in Tangiers ; so it's memories and family entertainment and I'm glad my son will get to know about the north of Africa watching this movie. Candice ****** looks beautiful and oo7/Connery is pretty funny indeed; and ***** ********* as played by ***** ***** quite impressive.
