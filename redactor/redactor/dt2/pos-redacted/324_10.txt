Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion. **** Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots.(In fact this was the only movie where he went outside India ever..that too just to sri lanka).****'s class is written all over the movie...and to add to it ARR's music..which is just amazing...****** ****** is one of my most fav songs ever... *****,who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too. Starting from alaipayuthey ,to kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru.. **** ratnam has showed to the world what a versatile actor ***** is. Simran has been really good too. She has showed that she can act too in non-glamorous and character roles. In all an amazing movie. *** that the tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and it bombed at the box-office....
