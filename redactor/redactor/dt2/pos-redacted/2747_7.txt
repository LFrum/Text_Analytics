Many of the earlier comments are right on the money, but some, well, not so much.<br /><br />This Is hardly a 'B' movie...it's well produced, the live flying sequences are really superb, and the model sequences are first rate. It's no "cheapie".<br /><br />****** *********** is quite good in this, and it makes a a nice companion piece for "Only Angels Have Wings".<br /><br />If you want to spot **** *****, spot J. ****** ***** first, they end up together.<br /><br />*** ****** is juvenile enough (and somewhat dull), but when they saddle him with the most pathetic pencil-mustache in Hollywood history, it makes his character even less believable. Sally Eilers is much more so.<br /><br />As for later influences, this is ******* in the early Airliner-in-Distress zone...the opening sequence of this film, with the Airline Operations guy arriving at the "***** ******* *******" would have fit very nicely into "The High and the Mighty"...just imagine ***** ******...and a 1955 Buick.
