The primary plus for this movie is the combination of ***** ****** and ***** *****. This was the first film in which this comedy duo displayed their Laurel-and-Hardy-esque brand of humor. ******'s obvious physical comedy skill is perfectly augmented by *****'s sarcastic take on every situation they find themselves in.<br /><br />This movie stands apart from other comedy movies. ***** Boy ranks in with Blues Brothers as a comedic work whose individual scenes and bits stem from the plot, rather than serve to break up the storyline and give the film a disjointed feel as so many other comedic films do. Thanks to excellent direction by *****, every scene is tight and immediately foreshadows or acts out the story being told. He is as much to credit for the film's hilariousness as ****** and ***** are. The acting of Dennehy, ****, *******, and many others (see the gas station attendant 22 miles from Davenport) strengthen the film.<br /><br />The film warrants multiple viewings because there are many fine nuaces to the film that may be overshadowed by ******/*****.<br /><br />I believe this film is very well-made and is THE funniest movie I have ever seen.
