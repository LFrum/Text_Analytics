******** ****** in his first starring role looks very young, acts well, but has a pronounced lisp only hinted at later in his career. Still, he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor.<br /><br />******* ******** is the real star here, playing a once-rich woman who's torn between her real love for ****** (he's broke too) and the comfort and security of marrying an older man (Hale Hamilton).<br /><br />Along for the ride are ****** ****** as ******'s trampy sister, ******* **** as her would-be producer, ******* ******* as the cosmetologist, **** ******* as Gilligan, and Halliwell Hobbes as the faithful (and wise) butler).<br /><br />Both ******** (whi had been a star in silent films) and ****** were trying to gain a toehold in talkies in 1932. ****** was a slow-rising actor from the Broadway stage; ******** was slipping and would soon appear in skid-row production like PICTURE BRIDES. Yet they are both very good here. ******** wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this film!
