****** ******* and **** ******, both of whom are sadly missed, proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen. This film is just another example of this.<br /><br />This time out they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board.<br /><br />Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named *** ****** who just enjoys harassing these boys. It's hilarious how ****** gives a quick lesson in dancing to ******* and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner *** McLanahan.<br /><br />Too bad that fellow dance instructors *** ****** and ****** O'Connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that. ******* falls for **** ******, on board with her fellow gold-digging mother, the usual outrageous ****** *******. Unknown to them, ******* has no money either. The widower ****** falls for ****** ** *****, looking lovelier than ever.<br /><br />The film belongs to ******* and ****** and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers.
