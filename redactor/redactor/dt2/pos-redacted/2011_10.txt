This was a modern TV classic! The story goes like this, *** has a girlfriend named ******. *** and ****** are in love and want to get married. *** has a bud named **** who he works with. **** is jealous of ******. He likes hanging around with ***. Now **** hangs around with *** *** ******. *** and **** have a secretary named *******. ******* is very accident prone. She is also, if you haven't guessed it, is kind of lonely. She too hangs around with *** and ******, and ****. Sometimes ****** wishes *** didn't have any friends.<br /><br />By the end of the first season, it looked like **** finally found himself a real longlasting girlfriend. *** and ****** went driving on the night before their wedding, making out in a tiny car and then getting stuck. Way out in the middle of nowhere! What happened next? What about poor *******? Did anyone get married?? *****, series ended.<br /><br />Not even a plea from TV ***** made FOX think twice about putting it back on the air. It was a great show with a great cast. I loved ******* too. She looked cool in those glasses and was hilarious. I miss this show a lot. This is like reading a good book with the ending missing......sad.
