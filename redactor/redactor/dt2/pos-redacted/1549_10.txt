Back in the 60's, this grim study of ***, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of *** *****, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time. By then I knew very little about ******, politics or the reality of the under-privileged, and I was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and ***'s monologues in front of the camera. I was also much surprised to find that Terence Stamp (who had become a celebrity, thanks to "***** ****", "The Collector" and "******* ******") had so little screen time. Although 20th Century *** distributed "**** ***" in Panama, ***** did not stay in mainstream cinema (which this film hardly is) and I lost contact with his films. I just heard of his successes, "Kes", "Family Life", "***** ****". until I caught up in the 80's. The beautiful title song by *******, by the way, is available in his anthology "Troubadour".
