It is a shame that this series hasn't been remastered and produced on video by ****** or some other professional movie house.<br /><br />Copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, being copies of copies of copies.<br /><br />As I understand it, 92 episodes were produced during its run, but only 15 are noted here.<br /><br />Some of the series writers, such as ******* ********, went on to become noted authors.<br /><br />Excellent series, well written, well staged and well produced.<br /><br />******* ******,<br /><br />Udon Thani, Thailand
