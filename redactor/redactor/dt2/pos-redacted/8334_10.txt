A SUPERMAN Cartoon.<br /><br />When America unveils its colossal new bomber, the JAPOTEURS, an elite force of Japanese spies & saboteurs, strikes. Stealing the behemoth, with intrepid girl reporter **** **** aboard, and the destination either Tokyo or destruction, it's time for ******** to get involved...<br /><br />This was another in the series of excellent cartoons initially created by *** ********* for Paramount Studio. They feature great animation and taut, fast-moving plots. Meant to be shown in movie theaters, they are miles ahead of their Saturday Morning counterparts. *** Collyer is the voice of ********; **** ********* does the honors for **** ****.
