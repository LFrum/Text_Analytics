Great adaptation of the ******** novel. Surprising attention to authentic period details for the time (Many films of the mid-1970s-early 80s that try to do 1920s-early 30s look far too mid-70s-early 80s for my liking, so expected the worst here, and was gladly proved wrong)The costumes and sets are very well done. I liked this production very much  largely due to the adorable ********* *****' portrayal of a carefree bright young Lady "*******" and ***** *******'s charming ******. The pair would go on to portray ********'s ***** & Tuppence, which is funny as some contemporary book critics compared ******* and ***** to her earlier characters of ***** & Tuppence. The supporting characters were equally well done  the over the top Mrs. Rivington (acted by **** Marple-to-be Joan H.) and "Badger" is played perfectly as the post WWI, "****** ******* type."
