In a lonely road in Cape Girardeau, ********, a black man driving a car is chased and hit by a truck, falling off-road and dying. His daughter ****** ******** calls her former boyfriend **** and asks him to investigate the mysterious accident. *** and **** see that three Afro-Americans and the Caucasian Major of the town were killed in weird accidents on the same road. When the truck threatens ******, her Caucasian mother Mrs. ******** tells a tragic racist murder that happened thirty years ago, and the brothers realize that they have to fight against a hatred spirit in a ghost truck.<br /><br />In this episode, **** discloses his first and unique love to his brother, surprising *** and showing that he has feelings, but also that his hunting wish is stronger than his love. The story is only reasonable, touching in the delicate theme of racism in an efficient manner and blending it with a supernatural event. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Rota 666" ("Route 666")
