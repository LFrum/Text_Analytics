This second full-length **** ****** feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with **** ****** adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice. ******* Moore and *** *********** star in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and cactus country of old ****** to good advantage. The music score is good but the familiar ******* **** ******** theme is nudged aside by vocals that are interesting but lack the flourish and beauty of the Ranger's traditional theme.
