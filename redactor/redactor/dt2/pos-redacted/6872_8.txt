HOUSE CALLS was an amusing 1978 comedy about a widowed doctor (****** *******) who now wants to play the field but can't help but be drawn to a patient of his (****** *******) who refuses to be just another notch on his bedpost. ******* likes the woman but does not really want to make the commitment that she insists upon so he agrees to date her exclusively for two weeks and then make a decision as to whether or not he wants to commit; however, other complications make it difficult for ******* to make a decision when the two weeks are up, even though he is clearly in love with the woman. ******* and ******* have surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and are given strong support from ******* ********, Candice Azzara, **** *******, and especially *** ****** as the inept and senile Chief of Staff at the hospital where ******* is employed. ******* even has a brief scene with his real-life son, *******, who appears as *******'s son. This engaging comedy still holds up pretty well after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth the rental.
