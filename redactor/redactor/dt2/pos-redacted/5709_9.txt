Four lovely young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives: sweet Susan (winsome brunette ****** ******) tries to comfort the bitter, terminally ill Greg (a moving performance by ******* ******), eager, but neurotic Phred (lovely blonde ***** *******) romances handsome gynecologist *** ****** (affable Lawrence Casey), free-spirited hippie Priscilla (the stunningly gorgeous ******* *****) gets impregnated by laid-back drug dealer *** (the solid ******* ****), and compassionate **** (nicely played by ****** *******) helps out angry Mexican revolutionary ****** ******* (the excellent **** *******). Despite the fact that this film was made for ***** ******'s legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures, it's anything but your standard mindless piece of leering soft-core schlock. Instead, it's a very pleasant, charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70's (the subplot involving **** and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative). Special kudos are in order for director ********* *******, who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material. Moreover, the four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and praiseworthy work. ******* MacGregor likewise impresses as wise supervisor Ms. Boswell and ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy ****** **** supplies the off-screen voice of a psychiatrist. ****** ******'s polished cinematography, the fantastic rock soundtrack, and the flavorsome folksy'n'funky score by ****** ** ***** III are all up to speed. A real sleeper.
