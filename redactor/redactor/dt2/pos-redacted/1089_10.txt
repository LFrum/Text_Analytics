I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak ******* was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and **** ******* was at his best. ****** was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up ****** for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen. I have not seen ***** as yet but I am looking forward for it. I for some reason don't find ***** ***** that exciting to watch on the screen - unlike ******.
