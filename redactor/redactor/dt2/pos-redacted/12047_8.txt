This was *********'s answer to Fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right. **** ****** was good and so was ***** **** but it was **** **** Khan who shot to fame as the stalker. Since then he has become a favourite of the Chopra's (***wale Dulhaniya le *******, ***********, *** to pagal hai, **** ***** and **** ** *****). **** **** at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him. The scripting was superb and the songs were chartbusters. My favourites are Too mere samne and ***** teri nazar.<br /><br />After the dismal failure of the underrated ***** **** ****** fought back with ****. The dialogues were memorable, the k..k..Kiran dialogue is often repeated. Since **** **** ****** has slipped bit. *** to pagal hai was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with **** *****, which was far far better. This was **** ******'s last masterpiece.
