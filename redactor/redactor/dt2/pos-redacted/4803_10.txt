Running Out of Time is probably as close to a perfect film as you're ever likely to see out of Hong Kong. All the elements click: a terrific script (by French writers ****** ****** and ***rent Courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the odd cliché, reliably imaginative direction by ******* **, and excellent central performances by **** *** and *** ***** ***, the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiating skills). The supporting cast is fine too, with ** ** **** making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the often histrionic ***** *** (looking remarkably, and very aptly, like a bald **** ***) reining it in to good effect. It's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set-up  with only a few weeks to live, *** engages in a criminal game with ***'s cop with no easily apparent motive  and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it's certainly worth the fare. It also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies, and played in a mere three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film-making I've seen in ages). There's also a fine score by ******* **** as well. The most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years.
