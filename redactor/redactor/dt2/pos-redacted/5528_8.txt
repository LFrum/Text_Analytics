I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. ****** - he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments. The reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful, thankfully, mostly due to the hilarious ******* ******* as the bumbling banker J. ******* *******. He is everyone's foil. He stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure. Also, his comedy partner, **** ****** plays his wife, Flora. Joining in the proceedings are ****** ***** and ****** *****. Boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but ****** and ******* use up most of the picture. ******'s funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. And poor ****** ***** has absolutely nothing to do except repeat ****** all the time. I don't remember laughing at him once (although he has one great scene with *******, where ******* tries desperately to get ****** to take ****** and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with ******, where he asks ****** to sell him a sweater; that bit is exclusively ******', though). The situation is constantly funny: the Whinneys are going to drive to California, but to help them with expenses, ****** and ****** are recruited. 8/10.
