It worked! ******** ********* ****** created a very clever action/spy thriller. The actors ****** ********** and especially ***** ***** gave a top performance. What a pity that we couldn´t see ***** ***** in others movies like this one till now. He was simply the best in the role as Ramirez/Carlos for what he should have earned the Oscar. The picture was very nice. The scenes are fast paced from beginning to the end and the story doesn´t let you a chance to get bored. The movie is too underrated and I recommend it to anyone otherwise you will miss something great. Believe me you will not be disappointed. That´s why i give it 9/10.
