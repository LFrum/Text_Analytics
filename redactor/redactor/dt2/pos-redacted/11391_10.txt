****** ****** was without a doubt the best film of 1997. I could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it. I'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance/disaster epic ******* again. The fact that ****** ****** did not even receive a Best Picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow-minded the Academy is. Only **** ******'s The Sweet Hereafter and ****** ********'s Contact came close to being as great as ****** ******. No other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as *********'s **** ******* -- until now. **** ****** ******** rose to the challenge and succeeded. Just as ********* gave **** ********'s career a kick, P.T. ******** has given **** ******** the kick that his career needs. ****** ****** will also undoubtedly make stars of *** *******, ******* ******, and **** ******. Overall, a wonderful film. The best since **** *******. Maybe even better.
