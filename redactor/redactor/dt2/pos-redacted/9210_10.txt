Very reliable entertainment, as *** ***** amuses as well as intrigues, very light hearted and very much bolstered by **** *******!! I like this television show and I think that many people watch it as a form of escapist voyeurism...Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many females in this series are very nice to look at...This show incorporates *** ***** legends such as ***** ****** as intermittent characters to authenticate the *** ***** genre!! There have been copious depictions of sin city, this is one of the better efforts...The producers and directors are lucky to have ***** **** in the show, as he is very much a totally accomplished actor!!! By and large, I like the T.V. **** *** ***** and I watch it on Fridays, I watched it on ******* as well, but with Monday Night Football, I could see why NBC switched it to Fridays...Nonetheless, I like *** ***** a lot!!
