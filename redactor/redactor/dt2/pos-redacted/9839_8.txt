******* ***** was a wonderful child actor who excelled at playing pugnacious little toughs with gigantic chips on their shoulders. He appeared in a couple of top films of the early 30s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), a ground breaking crime drama and "**** **** of the Road" (1933), a topical depression era movie about kids who ride the rails. He was essentially a younger version of ***** ******. Although short of height, his willingness to do his own stunts kept him employed in a series of programmers when the bigger studios had no more use for him.<br /><br />"Crime School" was supposed to be a remake of "The Mayor of ****" but it had far more humour in it and featured The Dead End **** and Humphrey Bogart as a very laid back Deputy Commisssioner. "The Mayor of ****" is really a combination of "****'s House"/"Crime School"/ "***'s Town". Even though ****** didn't make his appearance until around the 25th minute his impact (as usual) was immediate. He plays a hot headed gangster who is on the payroll of a political group run by the mob.<br /><br />***** ***** (******* *****) and his gang (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") run a car washing racket but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a general store and push the owner through a plate glass window. They appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state reformatory. It is painted in glowing terms - a model school where boys are given a chance to learn a trade. In reality, it is a hellish place run by a sadistic warden, *** ******** (outstandingly played by ****** ******). The only compassionate person is ******* ********, the live-in nurse (played by ***** *****).<br /><br />"*****" Gargan (***** ******) has been given the job as the new Deputy Commissioner, as a favour. On his arrival at the school he witnesses a failed escape attempt and after talking to Dorothy, realises the school needs sweeping reforms. He is soon running the school and brings in a system of "self government" - rather along the lines of "***'s Town". Even though ****** doesn't have a lot to do, the picture is carried along to it's gripping climax by the energy of *****. After "*****" is temporarily out of the picture (he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state), ******** returns and his brutal treatment, resulting in the death of a boy ("Skinny") turn the rest of the boys into an angry mob. They burn down a barn and ******** falls to his death - "*****" returning just in time to quieten the mob with some sobering talk.<br /><br />Sure, all the boys seemed to get was a stiff talking to for their crimes but I do disagree with one of the reviewers - ******** was more than just a "meanie". His sadistic treatment resulted in a boy's death. There is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served some inedible slop - ******** orders ham and eggs and keeps piling the butter on his bread while talking to Dorothy. <br /><br />***** ******* plays "Uncle" **** and ****** *****, although billed only as "a blonde" has one of the most memorable lines when she pouts and says "I thought there was going to be young boys here, where are they?"!!!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
