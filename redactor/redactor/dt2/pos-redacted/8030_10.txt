I'm a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films. The Assignment is based on a true story, which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen, and it really takes you on a fun ride. The film has a great cast, starring ***** *****, ****** ********** and *** ********.<br /><br />***** ******* ***** is a reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a chance meeting with ******** who believes ***** to be the famous terrorist ****** the Jackal. Because ***** so closely resembles ******, Sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death.<br /><br />The training sequences are awesome. ***** is really put to the test by ******** and Sutherland, having to withstand attacks from remote controlled snowmobiles, from eating the same food each day, to being drugged with a hallucinogen. He even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way ****** would.<br /><br />The film has some great action scenes with ***** eluding allies because they believe he is ****** and in his final mission when he is to kill the jackal. Throughout the film, ***** must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own. Will he remain as ruthless and free as ****** or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father? <br /><br />If you like the spy genre, this is a must see. The action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward; no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes. Rating 10 of 10 stars.
