That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? "The Best of Everything" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of "Valley of the Dolls". I mean, "Best" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase?), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.<br /><br />******** ****** (Hope Lange) and **** **** (the delicious ******* ****) are the centerpieces of the goings-on. Their chemistry is immediate and is the glue that keeps this film from becoming too fragmented.<br /><br />Suzy ******, the off-the-chart gorgeous ex-fashion model, appears as ***** *****, an aspiring stage actress, a role that, according to any biography I've ever read about her, was apparently not much of a stretch. But ****** does a surprisingly credible job here, more than holding her own in a couple of scenes opposite ***** ******* who plays ***** ******. ******* probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly headed down the aging star/has-been road.<br /><br />***** ***** is fine as naive, gullible April Morrison, ****** **** as ******* ****** has a particularly juicy storyline, and film legend **** ******** chews her usual serving of scenery as ****** ******, another role, like *******'s Savage, that ******** likely took for the paycheck.<br /><br />There is some obviously dated dialog and plot devices (this IS 1959), and the predictability of the soap opera genre. But if you like a good soap as I do, "The Best of Everything" will more than satisfy you.
