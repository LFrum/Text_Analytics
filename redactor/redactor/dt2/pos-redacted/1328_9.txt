*****'s twelve is probably better than *****'s eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(**** ******) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. *****'s twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than *****'s eleven. With a funny cameo by ****** ***** saying "I just walked in that new ****** ***** movie" and other things. I think *****'s ****** is probably the best in the series.<br /><br />The Plot: A year or so after *****'s ******, ***** ********(the guy they robbed in the last film) is back and says that if *****'s eleven doesn't pay him back the money they stole, he's going to call the cops. So ***** ***** and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old cop girlfriend ********. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. Also, the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are.<br /><br />With many funny scenes like when Tess(***** *******) goes to Europe and pretends to be ***** *******, *****'s ****** is a pretty clever film. It's cooler, funnier, and more entertaining than *****'s eleven.
