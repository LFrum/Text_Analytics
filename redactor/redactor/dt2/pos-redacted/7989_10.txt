****** ******* It is my opinion that the first ****** of the ****** series was only half the movie that ****** ******* is. In the first ****** by *** ****** we had only ****** and The Joker both played wonderfully by ******* ****** and **** *********.<br /><br />In ****** ******* we have what I feel is the most perfectly cast ****** movie (yes even better then **** ******). Keaton returns as ****** and is perfect in the role never going to far over top with the character of ******, which is perfect in this film when it comes to the two villains that he's up against. First you have ***** ****** who is delightfully insane as the Penguin. Then you have ******** ******** as Cat-Woman, who I dare to say is one of the most interesting and complex villains in the ****** movies. I feel this way about ******** because of the way she becomes the Cat-Woman she starts off as the rather pathetic mousy ****** **** and then truly dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant performance of a woman who goes from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I suppose back to a hero in the end. Also in this amazing cast you have the evil businessman *** ******* played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role there's something about this role that I love and maybe it's the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance all the better then it already is.<br /><br />Story wise I have to say that ****** ******* has so much more going on this time around as opposed to the first ******. Part of the reason I loved this story so much is the fact that ****** dared to go in a much more darker and twisted direction as opposed to *********'s over the top antics. You have the story on the Penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to decide just who she really is and what she should do with her new persona. When it comes to ****** I feel that in this one he's more the ring leader that holds the two stories together but of course kicking ass at the same time.<br /><br />************** was the film is dark and atmospheric just like the story that's taking place within it. Gotham City never looked as good as it does on Blu-Ray and HD so if you have the chance to see it this way then by all means do because it truly adds to the overall experience of ****** *******.<br /><br />So all in I truly feel that of all the ****** movies ****** ******* believe it or not tops the **** ****** for me because while I enjoyed that movie for ***** ******'s amazing performance as the Joker I felt that the movie was lacking something. ****** ******* lacks nothing, so if you want to see an amazing film with what I feel is a perfect cast then this is the ****** to light the Bat signal for.
