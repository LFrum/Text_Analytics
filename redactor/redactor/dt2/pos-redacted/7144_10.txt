This was a very faithful presentation of *****'s life in the mid-50's. The dialogue on theology and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good. ******* White's book, "C.S. *****: Creator of Narnia" deals with this time frame in a very parallel way. **** Ackland's acting was superb in catching the unemotional *****. The movie took great pains to be presented in an accurate English setting. The development of a strong bond between "****" (his preferred name) ***** and ******* *******, ***'s son from her previous marriage, was enjoyable to watch. The movie did avoid the distasteful element of "Warnie" *****'s (****'s older brother) drinking problem, but it would not have moved the story on, so it is best left out.
