Warner Brothers tampered considerably with American history in "Big Trail" director ***** *****'s first-rate western "They Died with ***** ***** On," a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer ****** ********* ******. The film chronicles ****** from the moment that he arrives at West Point ******* until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn. This is one of ***** *****'s signature roles and one of ***** *****'s greatest epics. Walsh and ***** teamed in quite often afterward, and "They Died with ***** ***** On" reunited ****** ** ********* as *****'s romantic interest for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute, black & white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes, and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries. One of the notorious errors involves Colonel Philip ******** who is shown as the commandant at West Point before the Civil War. Indeed, ******** was a lieutenant at this point. In fact, the commandant was ****** ** *** as the earlier ***** film "***** ** *****" showed. Another historical lapse concerns Lieutenant General ********* *****; ***** was not the commander of Union troops throughout the Civil War. Warner Brothers presented ****** as a drinker (probably because ***** had a reputation for drinking), but in real life ****** neither drank nor smoked. Nevertheless, these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film.<br /><br />"They Died with ***** ***** On" opens with ****** riding into West Point Military ******* arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an African-American carrying his luggage and tending his dogs. After the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant turns ****** over to a ranking cadet *** ***** (****** ******* of "City for Conquest") to take charge of him. ***** plays a practical job on ****** by installing him in the quarters of Major Romulus ***** (******* ****** of "**** *****") who promptly runs ****** out. Naturally, the volatile ****** attacks ***** in a public brawl. General **** ******** (**** ***** of "The Sons of ***** *****") is prepared to dismiss ****** from West Point for conduct unbecoming. As it turns out, ******** cannot expel ****** because ****** has not enrolled. Once he enrolls, ****** establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore. When the American Civil War erupts, West Point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat. One of the last cadets hustled off to war is ******. Avid as he is to get into the fight, ****** encounters his future wife, ********* '*****' ***** (****** ** ********* of "***** ** *****"), and they pledge themselves to each other, despite *** ***** (Gene Lockhart of "Carousel") who detests the sight of ******. It seems that ***** ran across ****** at a saloon and insulted one of ******'s friends and our hero reprimanded *****.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in Washington, ****** desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but ***** ***** has him cooling his heels. ****** befriends rotund Lieutenant General ******** ***** (Sidney Greenstreet of "The Maltese Falcon") and they share an appetite for creamed Bermuda onions that becomes one of ******'s characteristics. Not only does ***** see to it that ***** assigns ****** to the Second Cavalry, but also ****** appropriates *****'s horse to get to his command. During the Battle of **** ***, 21 July 1861, ****** disobeys orders from none other than *****, strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it. Wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, ****** receives a medal rather than a court-martial. When Confederate General *** ****** threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania, ***** is shocked by the chance that the South may triumph. When a brigadier general cannot be found, ***** goads ***** into promoting the first available officer. A mistake is made and ****** is promoted. Incredulous at first, ****** embraces the moment and cracks ******'s advance. After the war, ****** idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons. ***** shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist ****** to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds. Eventually, ***** intercedes on his behalf with General ********, who was in command of the army, and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, ****** finds the 7th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that ***** commands the liquor at the fort. Meanwhile, ****** has his first run in with ***** ***** (******* ***** of "The Guns of Navarone") and takes him into custody. Of course, ***** ***** escapes, becomes ******'s adversary, and they fight.<br /><br />Once ****** has quelled ***** ***** and the Indians, ***** with ***** as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the Sioux and other Indian nations. They also see to it that ****** is brought up on charges for striking ***** in a saloon brawl. On his way to Washington, ****** discovers the perfidy of ***** and ***** who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred ***** *****. Settlers rampage in and the Indians hit the warpath. ****** sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the Little Big Horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6000 redskins. "Stagecoach" lenser **** ******* captures both the grit and the glory. The long shot of the 7th Cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular. As an added premonition of ******'s imminent demise, ***** faints after he leaves their quarters for the Little Big Horn. "They Died with ***** ***** On" benefits from a top-notch Max ******* score that incorporates the regimental tune "Gary Owen."
