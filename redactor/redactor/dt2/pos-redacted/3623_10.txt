Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and *** ******** becomes *** ******* (played by **** ****** (I)). The interaction between *** and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by **** ******* ************, works very well.<br /><br />The rumour is that **** ************ and ******* ***** (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.<br /><br />***** was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.
