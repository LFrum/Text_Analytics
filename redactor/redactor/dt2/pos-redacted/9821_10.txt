A film for mature, educated audiences...<br /><br />I saw "****** ******" in an advance screening shortly before its North American release. This romantic drama was quite a treat. I'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.<br /><br />All-time Box Office Draw ******** **** ("**** ****," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "The Fugitive," "*** ***** One," "******* *****") is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer, Dutch. Ford's very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for ******** **** to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. Next year ******** **** returns to action, first for director ****** ******** ("Forrest Gump," "Back To The Future") in his summer 2000 thriller, "What Lies *******," and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of *** ******'s "The Sum Of All Fears." 'Fears' will be ******** ****'s third outing as CIA operative **** Ryan.<br /><br />Director ****** ******* ("Out of Africa," "The Firm," "Tootsie") has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to Scott-Thomas' congresswoman. It's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for *******. Not only is ****** ******* a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see "**** **** ****" as well).<br /><br />******* Scott-Thomas ("The English Patient," "The Horse Whisperer") shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Ford's quiet-man toughness.<br /><br />The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving Ford's character's investigation into police corruption. Look for a chilling & effective turn by "Heat" actor, ****** ********, who plays ********* ****** ********, the obstacle to overcome in Dutch's investigation into police corruption.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. ******* S. Dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and ****** ****, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as ***** Judd.<br /><br />The technical side of *******'s thriller is top notched. From **** ******'s (*******'s "The Firm") perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to ******** ********* ("A River Runs Through It") crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film's unfortunate downer premise.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a ******** **** film in recent times. "****** ******" is definitely one of the better films of the year.<br /><br />(***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)
