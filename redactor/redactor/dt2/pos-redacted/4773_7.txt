... But it is also ******'s and ****'s too! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like ****, but it is! ****** and ****** are the best characters, both of them are very sweet and likable. Interestingly, ****** is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and ****** is less than considerate in this than he is now. **** is still the same old meanie, but he looks a bit different. <br /><br />In this famous episode, on board a little steamboat, ******, ****** and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances. Even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. <br /><br />I quite like this episode, although overall I prefer the ****** ***** in the future. I like the animation, the steamboat and music theme, the clever gags - and of course, ****** and ******! <br /><br />Like many early cartoons, this is very random, **** came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to "gear" it along. There is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary. These are the things I do not like about it. <br /><br />Another interesting thing about this episode, that a colour version has not been made for it (or if it has, I've never heard about it)! <br /><br />Anyone who just enjoys ****** ***** and Disney will enjoy this.
