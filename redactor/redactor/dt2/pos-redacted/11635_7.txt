Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films ******** *** ******* did starring ******* *****. What a dandy it is! ******* and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearances unbeknown-est to each other. They then meet at a party and become smitten with each other. Now they can't allow each other to find out they're cheating. That's the preposterous premise of this frantic farce. ****** Oakland, one of the few comic short leads to have a flourishing career long after the silents, is perfect as *******'s long of nose wife. ******* has an awful case of buck teeth, which are quickly dispatched at the dentist's. After a party is raided by police for no other reason then to practice raids, ******* and his wife frantically try avoiding each other at home for fear the alterations in appearances become known. Both have been photographed with their new features at the party. The hilarity back home culminates in ******* trying to teach the no-good-nick cheating with his wife a lesson. The no-good-nick of course is the new *******, which his wife comes to realize long before ******* teaches a lesson in faithfulness. This is one of ******* *****'s better efforts. *** of 4 stars.
