Seriously, where is ** ******'s Oscar nomination for this one? Is it that we take him for granted at this point in his career? ****** here is extraordinary.. He gives a complex, heartbreaking performance as Shylock, the Jewish money lender.. the movie as a whole was quite great, with beautiful shots of Venice to look at and a pitch perfect score to listen to.. the other actors all do a fine job as well, but the real reason to see this is ******.. I have seen all the nominated Oscar performances of 2004, and I must say that ****** was snubbed.. blame it on the anti-semitism associated with the play, the lack of campaigning by the studio, the late release date with no major push, or most likely, all of the above.. in my mind, the best performances of the year belong to ***** **** in Ray, *** ******* in Hotel Rwanda, and ** ****** in The Merchant of Venice..
