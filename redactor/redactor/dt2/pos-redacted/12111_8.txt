***** ****** popped up in a sizable number of spaghetti Westerns throughout the 60's and early 70's; he was usually cast in secondary parts as nasty villains. ***** ***** lands himself a juicy lead role as ***** ****** ******, a foul, twitchy, and deranged sex maniac who comes up with a plan to abduct a lovely heiress in order to obtain her considerable inheritance. ****** and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan goes disastrously awry. Writer/director ***** ***** ably crafts a sordidly compelling portrait of a severely sick and twisted piece of sniveling low-life work: the plot unfolds at a steady pace, the tone is appropriately gritty and serious, and the exciting action scenes are staged with real skill and brio (the shoot-outs in rock quarries are especially gripping and thrilling). Ironically dressed in white, oozing oily charisma from every rotten pore, and jumping on beautiful women every chance he gets, ******'s ****** makes for a fascinatingly creepy and monstrous brute. ****** is simply spectacular as this gloriously repellent character; he receives fine support from the luscious ********* ********* as sweet, fiery saloon girl *******, ****** **** as the cheery ********, ******** *********** as ruthless band gang leader *******, ******** ********* as smart lawyer **** *********, and ***** ******* as ******'s sensible parter ****. Kudos are also in order for ******* ********'s moody and spirited score. Well worth seeing for ****** fans.
