This film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc-buster violent thriller/mystery/murder movies that abound. It is about real people making the best of their lives. They just happen to be Indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. The realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot. The sound track is by BC Smith, who also did the soundtrack for ****** *****, and is great. **** Beach plays a tribal policeman who is a little bit accident prone and *** ***** is the stoic consummately professional detective. There are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by ****** ******, ****** ********, etc. We have also seen ****** *****, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we greatly enjoyed it too.
