***** Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. ***** Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.<br /><br />He's even dumber than that. When **** ***** strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, ***** admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than ***** can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: **** *****. "Shoot him now!" ***** screams. "You be quiet," says ****. "He doesn't have to shoot you now." ***** insists that he does.<br /><br />After ***** returns his blasted-off beak to his head, he is doomed to more arguments infected with "pronoun trouble" which all have the same result. Later, **** dresses as a sexy woman and flirtingly asks ***** for a duck dinner. Will ***** get the last laugh? "Ha, ha, very funny! Ha, ha, ha!"<br /><br />What's funny about this classic cartoon? Bug recoils in fright as ***** screams in his face. **** ***** says "Yes?" while dripping with self-satisfaction. ***** Duck stands on tiptoes demanding to be shot. ***** Fudd whines that he "can't wait any wonger." ***** sees **** in women's clothes and makes that little noise with his tongue. **** Stalling plays "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby" during ****'s drag act. ***** demands "sheer honesty" out of ****. Stalling plays "Home Sweet Home" at an inappropriately appropriate moment. ***** tells **** he's "desthpicable."<br /><br />In five words: every detail of this film.<br /><br />NOTE: This short is available on "****** ***** ****** **********, Volume One," Disc 1
