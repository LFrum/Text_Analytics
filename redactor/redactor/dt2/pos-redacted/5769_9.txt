A sign of what to expect in this film came when I spotted that this was the first (and probably the last) film to have in its credits a "***** **********".<br /><br />In what is a couple of hours of silly gags, hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humour.<br /><br />This film was just what you'd expect from the ****** boys, and it is great to see them back in their best form after *** ******'s life threatening accident.<br /><br />Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (*********) are too similar to their ****** characters, if we can have any criticism at all, and ********* does a surprisingly good job in directing the film also.<br /><br />This film has already spawned the predictable comparisons to ****** ****** that just aren't there, and the Guest House Paradiso itself is hardly *******!<br /><br />Watch out for some excellently crafted dialogue amongst all the violence and mayhem.<br /><br />If you don't like ****** you'll probably hate this - but I loved it.
