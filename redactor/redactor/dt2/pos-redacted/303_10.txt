I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet ****** ***** outside the Santa ****** ***** Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for ******* and ****** to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. "******* Don't Surf". ****** ******'s famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the **** ***** tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
