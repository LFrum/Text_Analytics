A lot of people don't think *** ******* is funny. This movie proves otherwise. ******* is brilliant delivering his one-liners in this comedy. The only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from *******'s character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud. The doctor goes nuts like doctor *** ****** (******* ********) in "What About ***?". The scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to Los Angeles are silly, unbelievable, and unfunny. Other that this aspect the movie really is funny, especially the first half.
