This is the best version of Gypsy that has been filmed.***** ****** is simply superb as **** ******** has the voice,the gestures,the look,and most of all,a supreme acting ability to carry the role off and to make her character come alive.Her singing is,simply put:MAGNIFICENT! She especially shines in two numbers-"Everything's Coming Up ****s" and "****'s Turn". The other actors are also fine,particularly ********* ******** as Tessie.Also good is ***** *******;his portrayal of ****** is acted with great style and believability.The direction of this movie is very,very good.There isn't a false note or gaffe in the entire production.This film is a vast improvement over the Roz Russell version filmed in 1962.Since viewing it again,I can state that the three greatest Mama ****s are:***** ******,***** ******,and ****** ********. See this movie.You'll be glad that you did.
