Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause ********* is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. '*********' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who. The movie starts off with the old "assassination from a plane" routine. We all know that that is THE most effective way for taking out one guy in a picnic, full of people. Needless to say ********* survives the ordeal, but *****. **** *******, sorry ****** ****** I mean isn't that lucky. SMACK!! Also *********s best friend ***** is killed. This is the start of a grand adventure, filled with the hippest, funkiest music ***** ***** himself has to offer. That's right 'The Godfather of Soul' has put his trademark up on this bad-boy. In addition to *** ***** in the lead part, this movie is filled with some of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene has to offer. How about ******* ********, **** ******* ********, ****** ****** and ***** ******. In other parts we see none other than ****** ** ***** and last but definitely least the fantastic *** ****** as the evil henchman.
