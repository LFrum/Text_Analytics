Or if you've seen the "**** ****" trilogy and/or "***** Ho-Tep", then you should know that his movies are total farces. With "Man with the Screaming *****", he goes all out again. In this case, he plays smarmy American businessman ******* **** visiting Bulgaria - when do we ever get to see that country? - when a woman kills him. So, strange scientist **** ****** (***** *****) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent, leaving him acting sort of like ***** ****** in "All of Me".<br /><br />Yes, the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense. Much of the real humor comes from "**** ****" director *** *****'s brother Ted as ******'s nearly brain-dead assistant Pavel. The two men have a relationship more like ****** and ***** or Gilligan and the Skipper.<br /><br />So just understand that this is a totally silly movie, and you won't be a bit disappointed. I liked it, anyway.
