One of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's, ***** ******* was a low-budget film with high-budget returns. With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance, to a love story that all of us wish we could live (at least if you're female), this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again.<br /><br />The music, which is what drives the movie, is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer. From classic '60's hits like "Love Man" by **** ******* and "Big Girls Don't Cry" by ******* ***** to pure '80's hits like **** ******'s "****** ****" and ***** **********'s "Overload", ***** ******* is a mix of fun and sensual, showing the transformation of a young girl from shy teenager into a blossoming womanhood, all against the beautiful backdrop of a summer romance that we all hope and wish turned into more.<br /><br />The dancing in "***** *******" is not to be forgotten. ******* Rhodes shines in her role as *****, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and lithe gymnasts. ******* ****** does more than a fantastic job and shows off more and more of his skills, not just as an actor, but dancer and singer as well. And ******** **** shines as ****, while her transformation in dancing portrays her transformation in status as well.<br /><br />All in all, ***** ******* is one of the best movies of all time, and well worth watching at least once. It's doubtful that the first beats of the Ronette's "Be My ****" in the opening title won't snare your attention and draw you in to a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.
