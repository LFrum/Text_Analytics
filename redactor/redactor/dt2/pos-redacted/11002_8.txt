In "The Squire of Gothos", **** and his crew encounter a powerful super-being, who keeps the Captain, "Bones" and a few crewmembers captive for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think this is the first **** **** episode I ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more. It is not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid premise of an alien being who putting the Enterprise's crew in a corner, is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. In a way, the super-humanoid anticipates one of **** ****'s most famous characters, **** **********'s enigmatic "Q". This episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation: it is the first time ***** is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character ****** can be when the story allows her. Too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure.
