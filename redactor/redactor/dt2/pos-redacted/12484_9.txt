******* followed ** *******, where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected, with another masterpiece, **** des Orfevres four years later in which we know from the outset (or think we do) whodunnit. Top-billed ***** ****** doesn't appear for forty minutes by which time ******* has established a rich milieu of ***** ****, music publishers, etc and a fine cast of colourful characters; ****** ******** lookalike (Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris that same year) **** ****** scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husband/accompanist ******* ***** who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead. From here things go seriously wrong, his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his pre-arranged alibi is out the window whilst meanwhile, unknown to him, his wife confesses to the murder to the photographer neighbour, a closet lesbian in love with her, who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve ******'s scarf and as long as she's there,thoughtfully wipes her prints of the murder weapon, a champagne bottle. At this point investigator ****** gets involved and from then on it's a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air. *******'s output was relatively small but virtually all of it was, as ******* ****** said in another context, 'cherce', with ** ******* de peur and *** *********** still to come. In short this is a must for French cinema buffs.
