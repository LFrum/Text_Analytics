The entire civilized world by now knows that this is where **** ***** says his immortal "Hold hands, you lovebirds." But ***** ******, Professor of Music, steals the show. ***** him tutoring *** ***** as she fractures the "Voices of Spring." ***** Shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string. ***** him as he gets walloped by ********* ********. ***** him, and you will laugh and learn. Moe is no slouch either. ***** him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap. *****, as usual, is the Zen master of reaction. All in all, one of the very best Stooge shorts. You won't find one weak moment.
