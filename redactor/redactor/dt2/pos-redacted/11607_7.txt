******* ****  A passion play.<br /><br />Based on ************ ******'s novel of the same name, this is a classic tale of deception, adultery and relationship exploitation. Set in 1900 ******, director ********* ***** transformed the Nobel Laureates' acclaimed literature into a delightful visual treat.<br /><br />******'s story elaborately deals with the ******i society, through his central character, the rebellious widow, who wants to live a life of her own. We are taken into the picturesque part of ******, where we meet our heroine, the beautiful, young widow ******** (********* Rai).<br /><br />Despite her gorgeous looks, two handsome men, the rich ******** (Prosenjit Chatterji) and his friend Behari (**** Roychowdhury), denied marrying her.<br /><br />******** chooses a naive Ashalata (***** ***) over ******** and marries her. Leaving behind the country life, the free-spirited ******** accompanies ********'s mother to Calcutta as a caretaker. Soon, her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. It looks like, the two, addressing each other as '******* ****' (sand in the eyes), share an enduring bond. The English-speaking ******** captures a special place in the house. But, soon, she unmasks her real face. Manipulating good-natured *******, ******** gets closer with ******** and fulfills her sexual desires.<br /><br />When, she is thrown out by the enraged mother of ********, ******** seeks solace from a reluctant Behari. The remaining part of the story shows how the lives of these four characters crisscross and culminate in an unimaginable climax ********* walks through the rolea manipulative, rebellious lady, still gaining the viewer's sympathywith a ballet dancer's elegance. The other lead artistesProsenjit Chatterjee, ***** *** and **** Roychowdhuryare equally brilliant, in enacting their characters.<br /><br />While ****** penned this 'mould-breaking' story at the turn of the 20th century, the very idea of widow marriage was a taboo, even among the upper class! Narrating the nations' freedom movement in parallel, the author asserts the importance of individual freedom from the caged life. Kudos to the art director, who gave life to the early 20th century ******, and applause to the cinematographer for capturing those sets with verve.<br /><br />This 'passion play,' by ******, has been fervently converted to the screen by the ablest filmmaker without loosing its originality.
