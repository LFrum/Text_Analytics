exquisite!! in simple words... both ****** *** and ******* *** seem to understand each other quite well or maybe they both are just too good.this might just be her best performance as an actor and ******'s best as a director. yeah maybe better than Mr and *** ****. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. ******* **** plays the role of ******,*****'s(******* ***'s) elder sister. ******* **** made the best out of ******'s character for she had to play a strong,responsible,arrogant role of an elder sister who had the full responsibility of her family. ****** *** has beautifully crafted ******'s character,a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life,her love for her family.<br /><br />*****'s behavior was'not juvenile at all,for you can expect this from most of Indian directors for this role.looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of *****,a schizophrenic. When at times ***** is a normal,sweet college going girl,she also scares you when she is shown ill..both the sides have been beautifully judged and played..believe me it at times reminds you of the girl in Exorcist..not that scary though.. Overall..Marvellous piece of work by ****** ***,******* *** and ******* ****...
