This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene where ******* *****, sitting on a bus, casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrific. It defines his character beautifully -- a guy who's so low, he'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades. He lies easily as the situation calls for, and captivates the women in the Fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile.<br /><br />I couldn't help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of ******* ******. ***** and ***** ******* were teamed again, and **** ******* bears some resemblance to **** ********, with her facial bone structure and large eyes. Also, the Mona ******* character is not unlike the odious Veda in ******* ******.<br /><br />I agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was too pat, with the convenient tumble over a cliff for "****** *****", ******* *****'s character. Also, in one of the final scenes, we see bratty Mona ******* reunited with the boyfriend she had previously scorned in favor of the older, smoother ******* *****. I think the script should've called for her to be chastened for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister, instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well-made movie.
