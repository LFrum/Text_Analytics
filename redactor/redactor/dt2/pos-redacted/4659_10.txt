I have no idea what the budget on this movie was, but whatever it was they made it work! I have seen movies that spend 100x the amount (***** ****** anyone?) and sucked 200x worse. This movie has everything. ***** "*****' It" Naughton in the lead role as ****, an average college student who gets wrapped up in a game called the Great AllNighter" run by ****! This guy rocks! A "genius" with nothing better to do than come up with an elaborate game for a bunch of people to play. But he doesn't just pick his friends. He has a team of Jocks, nerds, fatties, average kids and of course, ********'s team who are the "bad guys". But this movie has no black and white. There are many shades of gray. **** is not the altruistic hero with no faults. He treats **** * * like crap. AND ******** is the way he is because of pressures from his Dad and a cranky stomach. The jocks play dirty, but so does everyone else! This movie rocks! The scene at the PBR factory? Classic! "******'s ***** **** *****?" Can you write a better clue? This stuff is gold *****! GOLD! Maybe I am from a different generation, but I love movies that seem far-fetched but still have roots in reality. This never happened...but it could. Eeeee-Gypt.... EEEE....Easter *****....Easter ******! Oh and watch for a young **** ****** still working on that *** wee character. PS That ***** ******* WAS/is HOT! She must have been one bad actress not to work in Hollywood anymore. SEE THIS MOVIE!
