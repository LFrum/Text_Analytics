"Medusa: Dare to be Truthful" is an outrageously funny parody that is a fine companion to the original, "*******: Truth or Dare". ***** *****'s brilliant creation skewers *******'s highly entertaining documentary (although it wasn't exactly daring, insightful, candid, or truthful) with a faithfulness to detail, right down to the packaging. I highly recommend this for ******* fans, ***** ***** fans, or anyone who enjoys sharp and clever parody.
