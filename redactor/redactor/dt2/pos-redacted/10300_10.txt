On the outside, this film is better because of ******* D'Onofrio (Law & *****: Criminal Intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version. In some ways, the 1999 version is better because it's more up to date (a decade as compared to the 27 years. The actors in this film were great, like ***** ****** (McManus of HBO's "Oz") as ***** **** and **** ******** (USA's Monk) and **** ****** (CSI:NY). Obvilubuly, dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences, nut much of the writing remained the same. There were stuff that wasn't in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy, but in the end, this film was just as great at the 1982 one. Character-wise: ******* D'onofrio playing **** ****** was excellent, better that **** *******. It's a match up between ***** ***** and ***** ****** in terms of *****. As for ******, I would praise ********. And between ****** ***** & ******* as ***, I would say Sinise wins.
