Lovely little thriller from *********, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists. ***** ******* is as ever a great hero for *********, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of *********'s black and white, low-budget original. Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.
