The cast for this production of ********* is excellent. ***** Gruberova sings ***** magnificently and passionately. ******* ********* also sings splendidly. Vergara is a fine Maddalena; ****** ******** is a famous older singer who sings the maid, ********. Weikl sings *******; Wixell sings both ********* and *********. As *********, Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this hard-to-beat ensemble of great singers. ******** Kuhlmann in the Contessa. All principals are well-known and world-renowned.<br /><br />This is an exciting ********* visually as well as musically.<br /><br />I have it on both laser disc and DVD. You should have it too!
