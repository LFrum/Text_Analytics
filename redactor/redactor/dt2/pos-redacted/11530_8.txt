It is 1969. ******(******* *****) is an 11 year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her 19 year old sister *****(******* ****). ***** is the doer, the truth-seeker, the fixer of all the wrongs in the world. Then one day, ****** and her mother Gail(****** ******) receive word that ***** is dead. ***** has killed herself. Both ****** and Gail are overwhelmed by this news and, although saddened, Gail mourns. ****** can't let it go. ****** decides to go to Europe and find out what happened.<br /><br />It is now 1977. ******(******* ********) is 18 and decides to go to Europe over the objections of her mother to discover the truth. When alive, ***** was inseparable from a man she called "****"(*********** *********). Though **** claimed not to know anything about *****'s last days, ****** convinces him to tell her everything. Within days, **** realizes that he hadn't let go of the past either and he joins ****** on her pilgrimage to Portugal.<br /><br />In the end, **** is able to tell of *****'s decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not preventing the suicide. Although angry, ****** realizes in the end how human and fragile ***** really was.<br /><br />I liked this movie. I'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the Red Army and I was 10 in 1969. This story was familiar ground for me. I can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to Canada or not to avoid the draft.<br /><br />The story is simple, but probably occurred several times in real life during that period. ******* ***** was enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young adoring sister excited by what was happening around her. ******* ******** slid easily into the role of the older ******. ****** ****** was the ever supportive mother, a role she is all too familiar with on American TV, unfortunately. I would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with. ******* **** played the immature anarchist perfectly. Though at times, her performance of a 1960s activist seemed to come off a news reel. Of all the characters, it was *********** *********'s ****, that made the most growth. When we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie, we can see he is a worldly man. He is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world's injustices. In the end, he realizes the direction he and ***** are headed is wrong and begins to "grow up" deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way. ***** refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death. Eccleston's **** is the most real of all the characters.<br /><br />I recommend this movie. It was enjoyable and thought provoking. "The Invisible Circus" is rated TV-MA, but there is very little cursing, sex or violence in it. The subject of the movie is the reason for the rating.
