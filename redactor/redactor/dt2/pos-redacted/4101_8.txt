The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of **** ********* and lyrics of *** *****. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch ***** ***, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, ****** ******* (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. <br /><br />The surprise here is ******* ***** as the elder **** ****. Who would have known? <br /><br />All-star cast including ******* **** and ****** ****** makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.
