Very literate, intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the Hungary of 1956 by invading Russian Communist regime. **** and ******* play lovers, she a British baroness, he a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country. Other New York theater stars of the period **** ******* & E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons, including ***** ****** in his screen debut. *******'s character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon-to-be communist country; she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles we've come to know today from Redgrave, Fonda, & ******. Leading the pack of Soviet wolves is *** *******, magnificent as a commandant and at his sexiest since he played opposite **** in "The King and I". He is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely, patrician, & heroic ****. This is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the Golden Era of American film. Do not miss it.
