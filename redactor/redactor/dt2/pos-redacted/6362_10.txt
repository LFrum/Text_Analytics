To say I wasn't expecting much sitting down to watch "The Couch Trip" is an understatement. I had no idea what it was about - I thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard ***** ***** played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word "couch trip," *wink, wink.* Then I figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. My expectations dropped even lower.<br /><br />I was literally expecting a grin movie - the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated. And in a way, this is cheap comedy - it doesn't have the greatest gags, the plot is ludicrous, but you know what? I had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time I was watching it.<br /><br />*** ******* plays **** *****, a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental. He gives the psychiatrist, ******** ***** (***** *******), plenty of grief and misery, which leads us to believe he is a sane person after all.<br /><br />Following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria, ***** is awaiting a tongue-lashing from ***** in his office when the phone rings. ***** picks it up, pretends to be *****, and finds out the caller on the other line, ****** ******** (******* *******), wants the real Dr. ***** to come fill in for a radio shrink named ****** ******* (******* ******), who is taking a vacation with his wife, Vera (**** *****). Michaels wants ***** so bad he has even booked him a ticket on an airplane.<br /><br />***** escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist, and drives to O'Hare. He gets Dr. *****'s ticket, gets on the plane, and eventually poses on the air as Dr. *****. His show is a phenomenal success. "People love him!" one man says, and the other man replies, "It's because he actually cares about them."<br /><br />****** ****** (the late, great ****** *******) is an ex-mental patient who recognizes *****' clothes to be confinement-issued pants and shirts. To keep him quiet, ***** promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret is kept closed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, ******* and his wife get in an argument. He flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not, in fact, Dr. ***** after all, but no one believes him. He gets the real Dr. *****, but unfortunately he has lost his ID so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story.<br /><br />Let me name just a few of the plot holes I noticed while watching this film: ***** poses as Dr. *****, but is never asked for his ID, even when claiming his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they would still make sure he is *****). If ***** becomes so very famous, how come the real Dr. ***** in Chicago never heard people talking about him? Word travels. And finally, why would the police ever arrest ******* and ***** (the real *****, that is) without following up on their stories?<br /><br />To be frankly honest, I couldn't care less. I went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - I really liked it. It entertained me. Its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic, but *** ******* gives a truly spirited performance as a half-a-loon that makes "The Couch Trip" a trip worth taking. <br /><br />3.5/5 stars -<br /><br />**** *****
