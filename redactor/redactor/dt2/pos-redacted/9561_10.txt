This flick was even better then 'Waiting for *******'. The great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by ***** and ****'s little second-second city troupe. If one finds this movie boring or pointless, *** help 'em, they just didn't get it. It is a mockumentary, something at which ***** and **** have a genius for. At the end of the movie where *****'s southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work on a 'caboose', or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic<br /><br />of an ancient Egyptian holding a tiny ancient Egyptian in it's hand, I realized it is moments like this that make life worth living. Thank you Mr.***** and Mr.****, and *** bless you.
