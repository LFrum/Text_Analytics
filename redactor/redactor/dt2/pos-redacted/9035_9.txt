Intruder in the Dust (1949) Dir: Clarence ***** <br /><br />Production: MGM<br /><br />Excellent 'Southern ******' tale, adapted from the ******** novel, about a black man, accused of the murder of a white man, who asks a young white boy he has befriended to help him prove his innocence. ***** ********* (***** *********) is something of an anomaly in this small town. He's a black man who owns the land he lives on and doesn't think much of the diseased social order that mostly keeps the peace here and in many similar small towns. So when ***** is found holding a gun over the dead body of ****** ******, shot in the back no less, young ***** ******** (****** ******) (who ***** once saved after ***** fell through the ice while hunting on his land) fears that the town finally has the chance to "make ***** a n*****." Arrested, and with a very real chance of being lynched before the night is through, ***** reaches out to ***** for help, as the only person he knows "not cluttered with notions". ***** asks his Uncle ****, a lawyer, to defend ***** and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions he agrees and they race against the gathering mob to save *****' life.<br /><br />The film has an uncommon frankness for its time and is mostly free of moralizing. The lawyer character has a tendency to speak incredibly self-aware dialogue that sounds mostly like something from the printed page, but it has minimal impact on the tone. That's a credit to the rich characterization of everyone else. ***** *********, who had mostly appeared in Oscar Micheaux films, is superb as the proud *****. ****** Hall as the murdered man's father, in maybe the best role I've ever seen him in, and ********* ********* as a plucky old lady sympathetic to *****' case, standout in support roles. The setting is perfectly realized. It is actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, ********'s hometown. ***** also uses the crowd in an effective way, it's always an anonymous mob against a single person (like ***** when he's arrested or **** when he's going up to his office), that is very threatening. Or the grotesquerie of the whole town gathering at the jailhouse to witness the lynching like it was a parade. Of note is an absolutely riveting scene when ***** and his friend ***** go evidence gathering in a cemetery. ****** Surtees (THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO, BEN-HUR) shot the picture. <br /><br />*** 1/2 out of 4
