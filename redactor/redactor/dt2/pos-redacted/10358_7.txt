I saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the London film ********. Structurally, it has been compared to **** ******* but it is perhaps closer to the structure of ****** ****** and the slacker mood of ***** *****'s Clerks. Four stories intersect at a French motorway diner. The first vignette has Franck (******* ****) bungling a hold up at the diner. The waitress, ***** (**** *********) takes pity and tell him her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (***** *******) and Paul (***** *********) take a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family don't appear to want her back. The third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner (***** ******* and Arno playing themselves). The final part is about four ex-criminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into Â… the diner. An 'epilogue' returns to Franck and ***** to complete their story (not really an epilogue, more a conclusion).<br /><br />The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in **** *******. Nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of ****** ******. The quality of the individual stories varies. The hideout story is a cute idea, with a couple of good gags, but does not come off; and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull. On the other hand, the kidnap story is hilarious, although its connection to the diner is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is the Franck and ***** one.<br /><br />This film isn't entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing more of Writer/director's ****** **********'s work.
