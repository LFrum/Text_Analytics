I think ***** ***** is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever! He gave us the awesome (at it's time)****** ******, shooting *** ****** to super stardom. Then followed that up with the second best movie ***** ****** has ever been in (The Last Boyscout).Stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but redeemed himself with this one, The Long Kiss Goodnight.<br /><br />If you're a fan of action films, this has it all...Action, Comedy, *******, then tops it of with more Action, Comedy and *******. ***** ****** is great, ****** * ******* is even greater. Don't miss it !<br /><br />9/10
