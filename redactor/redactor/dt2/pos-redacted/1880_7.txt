(Some Spoilers) It took some 19 years for ***** ******** to finally put his masterpiece " Man with the Screaming *****" on the screen. But ******** had to alter his story by having it, due to financial problems, take place in Sofia Bulgaria not where he initially wanted it to be filmed in Los Angeles California.<br /><br />In the film ***** ******** plays US pharmaceutical tycoon ******* **** who travels together with his spoiled rotten wife ******, ********** *****,to the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria. It's there that ******* wants to help finance Bulgaria's almost non-existent mass transportation system.<br /><br />It's poor *******'s misfortune to get involved with both Gypsy woman ******, ****** ******, and her ex-boyfriend *****, ******** *****, an ex-KGB taxi driver. The two, ******* & *****, will unwittingly end up shearing their brains, inside *******'s skull,because of ******'s jealousy and vindictiveness.<br /><br />After ****** murders both ******* and ***** their bodies are delivered to mad scientist Dr. **** ********** ******, ***** *****, by his loyal assistant *****, *** *****, to have their brains experimented with. Dr. ****** has this theory in that two heads are better then one. And now with the material, ******* & *****, available to him Dr. ****** at last is finally going to prove it. What Dr. ****** is going to sadly find out is that by fusing the two heads, or brains, together their brain waves will overlap and cause them to not only malfunction but turn against each other!<br /><br />******* with *****'s right lobe fused into his damaged brain is out to find ****** and make her pay for the damage she caused both him and *****. ***** for his part is stuck in *******'s head who's likes and dislikes, in both food and drink, are totally opposite to his own. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in them fighting for control of *******'s body!<br /><br />Things get even more screwed up when ****** finding out that ****** murdered her husband ******* confront her in the dangerous and high crime section of Bravoda call ***** **** and ends up being murdered herself. ******* back to Dr. ****** by his assistant ***** it's determined, with no body available,to plant ******'s brain inside of an experimental robot that *****'s been working on. The operation is a rousing success but the only drawback is that ******, with her brain inside the robot, has to have her brain recharged every few hours! Or, like a real brain lacking oxygen, she'll die together with the robot's batteries.<br /><br />Combination 1930's-like screw-ball comedy and horror flick with both ******* & ***** turning the Bulgarian town of Bravoda upside down in trying to find ****** and make her pay, with her life, for the sad state of existence she put them both into. <br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** It's Dr. ****** who in fact saves the day by discovering how to keep the two brains from fighting, and thus cooperating, with each other! This is done by him instead of fusing the brains together Dr. ****** keep them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall in between the two uncooperative globs of gray matter.
