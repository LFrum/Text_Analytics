It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the **** **** films (although i preferred the second) and ***** ***** (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love ********* ****, admire **** ******* and think that ****** ***** is *********'s most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from ****** ** ****. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.<br /><br />Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a ********* Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.<br /><br />So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.<br /><br />****** ** *********'s best work since ****** ***** it is a triumph.<br /><br />Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes *** **** is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr ********* for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in ***** ***** in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of *********'s own appearances in several films, especially ****** *********'s From Dusk Till Dawn, which ********* wrote.<br /><br />What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of **** ****. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. **** **** is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and ****'s performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. **** is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is ******'s blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is ******* ******** from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very ***** ****** vibe to him, and of course a suitably *** ****** edge.<br /><br />Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and ******* ******* (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by **** *****) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. ********* has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in ***** *****. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is ***** from OUATITW, *** ***** from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.<br /><br />That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only **** ***** comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic ******* ********** who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's ***** ****** leader.<br /><br />All the actors shine and ********* throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of *********'s **** ******** is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.<br /><br />It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.<br /><br />The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT.
