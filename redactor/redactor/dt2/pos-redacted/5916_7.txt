From director ***** ****** (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot), I can see that this is a bit of an under-shown and underrated film, one to be seen. This is the biographical story of ******* ******** 'Slim' ********* (***** *******), who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from New York, crossing the Atlantic ocean, to reach Paris, in a small cockpit. The first half hour or whatever is seeing ********* getting permission to do it, and the construction of the plane, named "The Spirit of St. Louis", and making all necessary preparations. Then of course the rest sees his perilous journey crossing the journey, overcoming tiredness, near fuel loss, and moments of losing sense of direction, but he was successful. Also starring ****** ******** as *** ******, ******** ***** as ****** ****, ******** ******** as ******** ***** *******, ****** *********** as ***** ******, ****** **** as Model/Dancer, **** ******** as ****** *******, ****** ***** as ****** ****, ****** ***** as ********* and ***** ***** as Goldsborough. Apparently ********* was a bit younger, so ******* was a shade too old to play him, but then again, you can't think of anyone else that could do better. It is a witty and emotional drama, with ******* (as always) being fantastic, great music score by ***** ******, and good direction from Wilder, a good little known gem. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Special Effects (the only award it was ever nominated). ***** ******* was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie *****, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 ***** - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!
