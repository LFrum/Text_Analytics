The hilarious team that brought you 'CNNNN' and 'The ****** *******' have returned to the ABC with their new series, 'The ******'s War On Everything.' Filmed in front of a live audience, the ****** team, once again, does what it does best- lampooning key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities.<br /><br />The satire is simply priceless, and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, the ****** Team has chased alongside the Queen (during her visit to Australia) to try and have **** ****** Dismissed and had *** ******* (Aust. ********** Leader) threaten to kneecap them.<br /><br />A particularly funny segment is "Mr. Ten Questions," showing an overly enthusiastic reporter who approaches celebrities (recently ******** ****** and The Backstreet Boys) and asks them ten such inane questions as "what is your optimum length of rice grain?" Just for the record, ****** ignored him and walked away, and one of the Backstreet Boys got angry and "refused to dignify it with a response."<br /><br />A segment that recently had me in stitches was when one of the team decided to become a 'statue busker' to score some extra money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real statue in his place. THE PERFECT SCAM! He got thirty dollars in twenty minutes!<br /><br />A brilliant satire of everything in Australian society. Two thumbs up!<br /><br />(By the way, the show won't be showing for the three weeks after ******, because "though the team are all atheists, they're also hypocrites.")
