If you've never been "*****tized", this is the ***** movie to see first. Amazing acting, supercharged soundtrack, and bust-a-gut humor blend perfectly with *****'s unique brand of storytelling and special effects. Despite straying from a word for word retelling of Romeo and Juliet, the fact that it stays in iambic pentameter gives you the odd feeling that it's closer to Shakespeare than that overdone music video with DiCaprio and *****. I assumed I'd seen the ultimate Shakespearian comedy when the cast of Moonlighting overhauled The Taming of the Shrew, but nothing comes close to Tromeo and Juliet. I strongly recommend the DVD version, which contains a second audio track with director ***** ******* which is just as entertaining as the main track.
