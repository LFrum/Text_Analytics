At the same time **** ******* was playing ranch owner ****** ********, trying to free his no good brother ****** ***** from sheriff **** ***** in Rio Bravo he was working the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the high point of Russell's career, his most noted screen role and his most famous television role, ******* *** ***** of ******* in ******.<br /><br />Russell kept law and order in ******* the same way that ***** ****** did it in ***** **** on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, ******* never developed the all the minor characters that gave you the feel of ***** **** at the time. Instead it concentrated on Russell taking care of business and learning the business of law to his eager young deputy ***** ***** *<br /><br />***** played deputy ****** McKay who was a most respectful young man, constantly referring to his boss as *** *****. He was pretty handy with a shooting iron, but was inclined to be impulsive. Good thing ******* ***** was around.<br /><br />The other series regular was the Kitty Russell of *******, **** played by ****** ******. This is where ****** most resembled Gunsmoke. There was an unspoken understanding between Russell and ****** that even the smallest of children couldn't have missed. And I wasn't the smallest of children when ****** was in first run.<br /><br />***** ****** ****** developed substance abuse problems after ******'s run ended. I remember a small obituary marked her passing in the first half of the Seventies. She was one beautiful woman.<br /><br />****** was good no nonsense western from that golden era of the adult television western. It was one of the best.
