I'm not a sports fan - but I love sports flics! So, why ... what is a great sports flic ... this one. And the storytelling style, is very fine.<br /><br />If you are looking for a reliably fantastic 2 hours of entertainment, "******** ****" qualifies mightily. Here is a movie that moves. **** ****** has gone to the same Director school as *** ****** - a.k.a. ****** Cunningham, "Happy Days". That is not bad. Look at the immense body of fine work that *** did after moving behind the camera.<br /><br />**** like *** was a great actor, but will be a superstar director if "******** **** Ever" is the indication of things to follow.<br /><br />Wonderful cinematography - fantastic direction - fine acting, especially by ***** ******, **** *******, ****** *******, **** *******, ******* ******, ****** Ashforth.<br /><br />This is a must see film not just as "feel-good", nor "sports film", this is very good cinema.
