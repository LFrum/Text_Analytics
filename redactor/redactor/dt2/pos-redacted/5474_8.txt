******** Petersen (Das Boot, *** ***** ***) gives us an exciting film where the accolades go to the supporting actor, **** *********. His criminal attempting to assassinate the President was first-rate and credible.<br /><br />That is not to diminish the efforts of ***** ******** and **** *****, or even **** ****** ********, who plays a real jerk of a White House Chief of Staff. Eastwood was great, and I love any film that Russo is in.<br /><br />The movie feature original music by five time ***** winner (Mal√®na, *****, The Untouchables, The Mission, **** of Heaven) ***** *********. That alone makes it worth your time.
