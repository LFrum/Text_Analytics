I like the phrase "British post war suburban paranoia" that one of the reviewers used. It describes so well the kind of films **** ***** excelled in ("The October Man" (1947), "The Long Memory" (1952)) in between "big" pictures ("Scott of the Antartic" (1948) and "War and *****" (1956)).<br /><br />This distinctly "**** ******" style plot had **** ***** playing Dr. ****** *******, who promises his friend, *******, (unseen) to meet a visiting German actress, ****** ****** (**** Daniely) at the airport. A creepy "reporter" ******* ******* (Lionel Jeffries) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down Windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting!!! (something fishy is going on!!!). ****** is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it.<br /><br />The next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work, further more, he finds his friend ******* could not have rung him as he is still in New York and Windsor doesn't seem to exist. Earlier on a patient, *** ******(**** ***) who has been referred to him by ****** ****** Kimber (Mervyn Johns) tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. It is a nightmare that is coming true for ****** but of course when ********* ********* **** (Roland Culver) interviews her, she denies all knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found in the boot of ******'s Daimler.<br /><br />When ****** is lying low, ****** ***** (******* Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches ****** gave ****** at the airport. ****** returns to the flat, ******* rings and while ****** is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches!!! Who can he trust - who hasn't something to hide!!!<br /><br />This is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as "The October Man", but with **** ***** doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries!!!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
