I love this movie! It has everything! ****** **** did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. ***** Duchovny is just plain hot. and ****** ****** is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with ***** ***** *****, ***** ********, ****** ******, ***** **********, and *** ******* you have a Oscar worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once then put directors commentary on...****** **** is ********!
