***** ****** and *** ********* together - what a treat! With ****** ******* and ***** ******* rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. "Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life." How true these words are. ******'s **** ******* is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred. <br /><br />The circumstances of lies are to each its own: one to defend one's professional name; one to hold back due to family/partner pressure; one simply don't want to face the consequence; one ironically can't believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue - fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. Contradictions, indeed. In spite of the seeming dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. <br /><br />The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. It's not sensational or complex as another film "Where the Truth Lies" 2005. Credits due to ********' writing and the nuanced performances of both ****** and *********. There is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. Beneath it all, human frailty not excluded, they meant well. And following along with the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two Manning's seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /><br />You might say there's no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in "Separate Lies," yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention. The deserving production efforts include cinematography by **** Pierce-Roberts (a veteran to the Merchant-Ivory films) and music by ********* ********, with mood and tone reminiscent of composer ******* ******** (of filmmaker ********* **********'s ***** ********, especially: Bleu 1993.) This is a British film you just might not want to miss. <br /><br />***** ****** (****, the wife): Breaking the Waves 1996 debut; ****** and Jackie 1998; The Luzhin Defence 2000; ******* **** 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, *** ******, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /><br />*** ********* (*****, the husband): The Full Monty 1997; The Governess, **** **** (as villain) in 1998; In the Bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO cable movie) 2003, ******* ******** of the Spotless Mind 2004, recently as ****** ***** in: The Exorcism of ***** **** 2005 opposite ***** ******. <br /><br />****** ******* (****): He is simply delightful in "My Best Friend's Wedding" 1997 opposite ***** ******* and marvelous in "An Ideal Husband" 1999 d: ****** ******, an ***** ***** play.
