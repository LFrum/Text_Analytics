Just Go see this movie. It taps into everything awesome about rock and roll, the band comes up with some great songs (Classico, **** of Destiny, ****** ******** etc). All this with the Humor of Teancous D makes this the best movie ever.<br /><br />The Cameos are great right of the back, with **** **** and *** singing to JB. *** Stiller and *** ******* are great, I really like *** ******* character. You also find out who ***** really is! The Music and Musical references are hilarious and *******. Playin songs great songs from The Who, ***, and others just complete it. i personally didn't think the band could top the awesome songs of the D, but they did with songs like Classico and ****** ********. Seriously awesome music.<br /><br />Just go see it, its a must for anyone who loves rock!
