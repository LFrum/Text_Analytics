Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked **** ******** in this, though I'm wondering why ****** wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with ********. A nice sequence was the whole "swimming" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.<br /><br />One negative comment: ****** ***** was grossly miscast. As the detective, the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse.
