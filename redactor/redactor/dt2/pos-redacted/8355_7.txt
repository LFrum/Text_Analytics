Well, first of all, it's not a bad movie. It is good, and I like the characters introduced. I also like **** and *****'s voices more in this.<br /><br />However, I would like to see **** And ***** more. I know it says '*****'s *********', and I love ***** And ***** to bits, but it's a sequel to the original, where in my opinion, they should of just released it as '*****'s *********', not '**** And The ***** II:*****'s *********'.<br /><br />***** did have quite a role, but he didn't have much time with ****.<br /><br />But anyway, the songs are quite good, and ***** and ***** are sweet. I've seen better sequels, but hey, it's not a failure.<br /><br />I give it 7/10. Very good, but still had flaws.
