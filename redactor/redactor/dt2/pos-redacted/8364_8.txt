****** was okay, but **** **** was my favorite when I was a kid, I mean before there was *** ****(2005) and Zoom(2006), there was **** ****, a school for super hero's in training, Teenagers with super powers would help police capture bad guys, and other times they would get in embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero(1981). It was a fun cartoon to watch, what was also fun, was the live action stage show called The Kid Superpower Hour with ******. The actors who voiced the characters, also dressed has there characters in the show. *** Ruthless(**** *******), ***** *****(Jere Fields), WeatherMan(*** *********), ******* **********(***** ******, who also sang the theme song), ***** ******(***** ********), ******** ***(***** *****, who looks like the love child of Superman and ****** *****), and **** ****(****** ********). The whole cast just went with anything, when it came to the jokes. The cartoon was a fun superhero comedy, I shore up it will come back in live action like *** ******(2004)
