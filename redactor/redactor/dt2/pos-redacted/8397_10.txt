Gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed . It is by far the movie of all movies . The romance between ******** and ***** made people dream all over the world and turned the lead actors into cinematographic icons . One can ask , is it really necessary to make a sequel ? And ... there are some big shoes to fill .<br /><br />Well , there was the book first . '********' by ********* ****** is , we have to admit , well-written and fully respecting the world created by ******** ******** . She picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently leads us from Mitchell's heritage into her own fantasy . In the book ******** , defeated after *******'s death and *****'s leaving , travels to ********** to reside with her mother-in-law in hope of regaining *****'s love . Her typical manipulative behavior evokes once again a lot of criticism from ***** and drives them further apart ... until a certain boat trip that will change everything . ******** now carries a secret . The series follows the book quite accurately until the arrival of ******** in Ireland . From then of , book and series slowly split ways . The actual end differs , but of course the both have ******** and ***** back together .<br /><br />The production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next ******** O'Hara . Many countries made their own television shows featuring young actresses auditioning for the part . Eventually , about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen tests and interviews in Atlanta , Georgia . Unfortunately , the producer found no ******** amongst these actresses . *** for the girls , major publicity for the show ( it was already sold to many television stations worldwide before shooting even had started ). ****** ***** , the producer who bought the rights to '********' , told he discovered the right actress while watching TV , gave her a call and two days later signed the deal . ****** Whalley-Kilmer ( who starred in'Willow' and 'Scandal' , the latest being the movie ****** ***** was watching that faithful evening )is not ****** ***** , but she certainly is ******** ! Her performance is not a copy of Leigh's , she makes the character her own . The major difference between GWTW and '********' is the fact the lead character evolves and grows as a person . This is the series prerogative , why copying something that has been done before ? Considering there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and second storyline , it is natural that both authors emphasize on different aspects of the characters . ******* Mitchell works around ******** dealing with the consequences of the civil war and fighting for **** , ****** lets ******** face her demons . This to me , is the most interesting aspect of the series , we get to know ******** in a different way as she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants . I totally agree with the choice of ******* ****** as ***** ****** . He portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than ***** *****'s performance . The rest of the cast was well chosen . ***** ****** is endearing as *****'s mother , **** ******* gives a very amusing performance as grandfather ********* and **** **** is always at his best playing a dirty character , his Lord Fenton makes no exception . Poor choices however with ******* ******* as ****** and Ann-Margret's adaption of Belle Watling was a waste of money . Costumes , sets and locations are elaborate and convincing . The newly built **** set looked exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house appears for the first time .<br /><br />Is there a point in making a sequel ... Well , six hours of romance are to me . One to watch !
