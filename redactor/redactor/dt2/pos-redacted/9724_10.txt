Series as a whole - *** ******'s best work. **** **** *is* the Storyteller. Often Oscar-caliber screenplays, not surprising when you consider ********* doing the writing. Oscar-caliber acting, always.<br /><br />********* - Everybody loves 'The Soldier and *****,' but something about '*********' pushes it an iota higher in my favor. In the first ballroom scene, the costumes, the music - perfection. **** and the dog typically semi-interact with the story, but this time ********* pushes it up that extra notch in the 'ring' scene between **** and *********. The chemistry between characters is especially well-developed, more so than usual in the series, in reference to the friendship between *********** and the prince. Seen it? See it again. Pay more attention (to those of you who don't fanatically adore this 22-minute piece of cinematic perfection). Never seen it? I am so, so sorry.<br /><br />**** ***** - not as sophisticated as *********, but very clever in its own right. This is a story about irony. Irony upon irony, within irony... I love it. Every character is acted to perfection, with the exception of the ferryman. He was doing drama; everyone else was doing romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite of the primarily comedic episodes, '*********' and 'The Soldier and *****' being examples of more dramatic episodes.<br /><br />Side note: Greek Myths. What it lack in ********* subtlety (different writer) it partially makes up for in boldness as it portrays the four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than is usual. Also check out the *** ****** Hour if you can get your hands on it. For Storyteller adicts, it features The Man Himself introducing the myths, the lion from 'True Bride,' and... No Annoying Opening Theme! **** Storyteller, half pure, unadulterated muppet wit.
