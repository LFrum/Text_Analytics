I loved the film "***** ******". The film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. I especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. ***** ****** has **** **** potential both in looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of **** ******'s. **** ********* took this movie to a new level.I loved the cast. The music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in ***** ******. **** ********* is an incredibly talented and gifted director. He gives his work 200%. The film has great texture. I hope that there will be an ***** ****** 2. I would love to see how ********* turns out after getting her windfall of money. **** *********'s ***** ****** is ********* level.
