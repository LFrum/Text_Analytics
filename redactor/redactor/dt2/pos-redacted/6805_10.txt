This is the first movie I ever owned on video, and 14 years later, I still have the same copy. ********* ****** was as radiant at twelve as ever later in life, ****** ****** gave real dimension to ** ******, and ****** ***** was solid as ever as *** *****. The amazing **** ******, as Mrs. *****, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. After nearly 60 years, the warmth, humor, and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; we still laugh at the jokes, root for The Pie, and love ****** for the spirit and capacity for love that she displays. I love it as an adult just as I loved it as a child. A must for every family video collection.
