Not since ***** *****'s 1933 vehicle "Ex-Lady" have I seen a film that was so much better than its star said it was! Most of the bum rap "***** *," a.k.a. "Utopia," a.k.a. "******** **********," a.k.a. "Escapade" has got over the years has come from the horror stories **** ****** told of its production. Given that he suffered a stroke during filming, looked like death warmed over through much of it (from the opening two-shot of them together you'd never guess that ****** survived ***** by eight years) and was subsequently diagnosed with diabetes (once he adjusted his diet accordingly he restored himself to health), one can understand why ****** didn't think this film was the most pleasant experience of his life. Yes, it's flawed: the cheapness of the production shows through, the dubbing is awful and ****** and ***** were too old to do the energetic slapstick of their greatest films. But it's still genuinely funny, and *** *******'s story introduces elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communalist) one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like ******* or the Marx Brothers but never from ****** and *****. The film deserves credit for being different (though its debt to the Ealing Studios' classic "Passport to Pimlico," made just a year earlier, is pretty obvious) and for integrating the ****** and ***** comedy into a rather edgy context completely different from anything they'd used before. This isn't a great movie, but it's certainly better than the eight dreary ones for *** and MGM they'd made in the early 1940's. I suspect only the film's technical crudity kept it from earning the cult following among anti-establishment baby-boomer youth the Marx Brothers' "**** ****" acquired in the late 1960's/early 1970's.
