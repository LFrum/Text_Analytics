In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders ****** (*** *******) and ***** (***** ***** Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. ******** **** (**** *******) and the prostitutes Denver (****** ***) and ********* ****** (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws ***** boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them. When the Navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dancing party. When the wagon train is near to their destination, the ***** boys threaten the settlers, forcing ***** and ****** to take an attitude.<br /><br />"***** ******" is another great western of **** ****. The sequences with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. The adventure of the group of Mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "*******a dos ******" ("******* of the Braves")
