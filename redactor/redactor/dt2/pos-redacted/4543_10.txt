For fans of ***** ******, this is probably his best film. ***** ***** plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic yin to ******'s "**** ****" yang. ****** achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues, like the "Let's say you're driving along the road with your family..." bit, the "Jo-Jo the Idiot Circus Boy with a pretty new pet, (his possible sale)" speech, or the "Glue-sniffing Guarantee fairy" brake pad sale. The sappy moments in the film contrast sharply with ****** and *****'s shenanigans. Even after many viewings, it's still fun to see ****** pour everything he had into the role. "*******, what's HAPPENING to me?!?!"
