I've seen ***** ******* in all the regular roles, but the "Spirit of St. Louis" was reported to be one of his favorites. A poor box-office performer when released, this film has been largely forgotten today. Telling the well-known story of ********'s famous flight in 1927, ******* seems to be badly miss-cast at first, and his well known voice never lets you forget who you're watching; it feels like ****** ***** all over again. But ******* obviously worked hard on the role and he does everything right, so before long you don't care anymore that ******* was 20 years older than the man he's portraying. *******'s ******** is so gosh-darn, all-American, apple-pie likable that you get caught up in the story, and you realize that ******* intended to portray ******** with all of the aw-shucks, Yankee-know-how he could muster up. ******** was an almost mythical hero in the U.S., and ******* seems determined to keep up appearances.<br /><br />Flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a rather dull story moving along, and I was struck by the subtle references to ***** that were scattered through the film; ******** trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly, only to be confronted by the priest on his beliefs, or ******** refusing to carry a proffered St. Christopher medal to save weight on the plane, only to find the medal hidden in his lunch bag after he'd crossed the Atlantic. For me, this is a film not about a man's epic journey into the unknown, but his realization that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel.
