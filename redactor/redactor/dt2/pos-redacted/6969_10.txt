******** ** may not be the best out of the series but it isn't too bad, if you don't take it fully serious then you may enjoy it.<br /><br />It's nice to see ***** ****** return as ********* ****** who has gave up using magic and has became a Detective but still thinks about what happened in Ghoulies.<br /><br />The plot is about a woman named ********* that is *********'s ex-girlfriend that breaks into a museum and takes a red gem, using the gem she awakens her boyfriend named ***** that is *********'s dark side but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and **** is sent to hell.<br /><br />Something goes wrong and **** loses the gem so she needs to find a new one, as she leaves the gateway is still open and two little Ghoulies named Lite and Drak appear. They're not the true Ghoulies since they look like guys in a Troll costume wearing a mask but that doesn't matter since they are humorous in parts.<br /><br />Lite and **** need to find ********* since he can return them home so they go around causing mayhem as they try to find *********. Another difference is that the two Ghoulies are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous films.<br /><br />I found ******** ** to be good but this film may not go for everyone, check it out if you like low budget films like Troll 2.
