I was fifteen." Eventually, he ended up working as an usher at the LA Paramount and within a few years fell back asswards into one of the greatest songwriting careers in the history of American music. 'Who Is ***** ******* (And Why Is Everybody Talking' About ***?)' chronicles the legendary life of " the best songwriter of our generation." Writer/Director **** ********** produces a 'who's who' of musical royalty, from Brian ****** and ** ****** to **** ********, ***** ****** and *** ******, "His voice was a medical instrument. It would heal you." Assorted archives include his 1969 appearance on 'Playboy After ****' and *******'s BBC special. The **** ******, brandy *********, Smothers Brothers at the Troubadour comeback-show heckling debacle is one memorable recounting among so many they seem to virtually squeeze *******'s enchanting music out of this comprehensive and bitter-sweet bio-doc.<br /><br />"He was a wonderful perpetrator."<br /><br />"  I woke up three days later, getting a massage in Phoenix."
