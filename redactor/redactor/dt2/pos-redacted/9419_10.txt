A brilliant Sherlock ****** adventure starring the brilliant ***** ******** and ***** *****. Despite many other actors brilliantly playing ****** and ****** and making a great job of it- Rathbone and ***** will always be the best two.<br /><br />****** takes a Professor ****** from Switzerland to London. ****** is wanted by the Nazi's. He has a bomb sight that could win the Second World War. His bomb-site has been split into four parts, each hidden in books. ****** agrees to give his bomb-site to the British government. On the night of his arrival, ****** goes to the house of his girlfriend. He has drawn some figures of men, if ****** was to disappear, the lady was to give the drawings to ******. On his journey home he is attacked, but a Policeman stops this and the attacker runs away. ****** is happy for the British government to use his bomb-site but refuses to give it to them, ****** wants to look after it. The bomb-site is split into four parts, each part completely useless without the other. He gives one part each of this bomb-site to one of his scientist friends. Then ******'s greatest fear happens, ****** goes missing. ****** visits the young lady ****** was with the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings have been stolen. She says only one man came in during the time ****** left, to fix the light-bulb. The man she describes is Professor ********. He is working for the Nazi's. Seen as he has the drawings, ****** is done for. But he finds the writing pad he used and using Science, he manages to see what ****** drew by looking at the next page on the pad. He sees it's code. He sees it's the name of four scientists. The first three he works out the code for, but he can't work out the fourth. The three scientists he has worked out have been murdered and the bomb-site has been taken. ****** can't work out the fourth scientist, but neither can ********. Disguised as a sailor, ****** manages to get in ********'s office. ******** sees straight away it's ******, puts him in a box and has him thrown in the sea. But ****** and ******** insist they search the box and find ****** in it. It's now obvious ******** is at large. ****** manages to work out the fourth code, a Frederick *******. ****** gets round to his house straight away and get ******* and the decisive fourth part to safety. ****** now needs to get ******** charged for working with the Nazi's. He pretends to be *******. ******** works out the fourth code and gets two men to go round and get *******. They take him back and he comes face to face with ********. Meanwhile ****** is not in a good way, he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. ******** has had it with ****** now, he has got him and his death must be a long one for ******. The idea is to put him in his hospital, put a needle in his vein and watch him die of blood loss, drop by drop. ****** runs in and saves the day though. ******** gets away, but ****** was only careless enough to leave ********'s trap door open. ******** plunges sixty feet.<br /><br />So, ******** dead. No. He makes his final outing in the film 'The Woman in Green' but in 'Green' he is definitely dead, a suicide, he jumps off his roof. It was ********'s second of three appearances in the Rathbone series, a different actor playing him on each occasion. His first appearance in 'The Adventures of Sherlock ******' was played by ****** *****, his second in this film he was played by Lionell Atwill and ***** ******* plays him in his final outing in 'The Woman in Green' The first three ****** films made by ********* were set in the war as ****** triumphs over the Nazi's. 'The Voice of ******' was the first, then this film and then 'Sherlock ****** In Washington' Then it was back to Victorianish times, with definite relations to Edwardian and Georgian (George the fifth and sixth) times. This film had a close link to the Sherlock ****** short story 'The Dancing ***' which can be found in 'The Return of Sherlock ******' A great film, though obvious propaganda, it was a brilliant ****** outing.
