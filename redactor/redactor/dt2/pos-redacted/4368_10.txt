This British film version of the stage play I AM A CAMERA is based on *********** *********'s "****** *******." This is the source material for the famous musical CABARET.<br /><br />***** ******, a major stage actress of her day, reprises her 1951 **** Award winning role as ***** ******. She's a far cry from the Liza Minnelli character but the basic "*****" is all here despite the various film codes that would have blocked this story from being filmed in Hollywood. ****** is perhaps stagy but she's also quite good as the madcap and maddening *****. Her singing number is obviously dubbed (by ******* ******** no less) although ****** apparently sings for herself in other moments.<br /><br />Laurence Harvey (with the very ugly hair) plays ********* with zero charm and can't even make the character interesting. ******* Winters does little with the role of Natalia (****** ******* won a supporting **** for the play), and ***** ******** is OK as Fritz. *** Randell plays the caddish Clive but seems a tad loud. *** Seidl is funny as the landlady.<br /><br />Yet despite the overall staginess and cheap look, ****** takes center stage and she is amazing. This film was released the same year as EAST OF EDEN in which ****** gives a glowing performance as ****. Comparing the two performances gives a good look at the talent **** ****** possesses. These two characters couldn't be more unalike. ******' ***** preens and prances about and growls out a very lascivious laugh. She also acts circles around the boring Harvey.<br /><br />Without the music and with a familiar storyline, many viewers may find little here to recommend this film, but it's a great chance to see the great ***** ****** repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951.
