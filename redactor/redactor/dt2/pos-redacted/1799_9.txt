"****** ****" launched ******* ****'s career and was an 80's version of "***** and Juliet." It is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. ******* ****, ******* ******* and ********* ***** all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top "**** ***** at Ridgemont High" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for "**** *****," then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure.
