****** Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature **** Bunny/***** Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. **** **** and ***** stirring up "pronoun trouble" with ***** always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. ***** ***** and ******* ******* are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid. And at least two of them end with *****'s exclamation to ****: "You're despicable!" Can't get better that that!
