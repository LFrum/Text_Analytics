TV movies generally do not receive as much recognition or credit as great films - and it is usually for good reason but the 1996 HBO movie The Late Shift is easily one of the best TV movies ever. Based on **** ******'s revealing book, The Late Shift is about NBC's handling of late night talk show hosts ***** ********* and *** **** when it came to filling the vacant ******* **** seat once held by ****** ******. We see what happens in front of the camera - author **** ******, director ***** ******, and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off.<br /><br />Unfortunately we can never really know for sure what really happened when it came time for ****** ****** to be replaced by either ********* or **** - but The Late Shift gives us an interesting possible reality. While simply being a very well made film, The Late Shift also does a really good job of portraying all the sides fairly equally - although you wonder if the film makes ********* and **** out to be too nice of guys; especially ****, who seems a bit too saintly.<br /><br />The performances are also very good. In a very deserving Golden Globe-winning performance, ***** ***** plays ****'s extremely pushy manager ***** ******** who, according to ****** and the book/film was very problematic for the studio and **** (the real ******** actually suited **** ****** for libel over this portrayal!). **** ******* ******* breaks out of his usual gigs of getting small quirky comedy parts and gives an excellent performance as ***** ********* - giving an excellent impression of ********* but also creating a dimensional and relatable character. ****** ******* gives a good performance as **** but does not quite measure up to some of the other talent in the film - ******* probably did the best anyone could have done, it is just looks hammy whenever anyone tries to do an impression or portrayal of ****. *** Balaban (a squirrelly ****** ***********), ***** ******** (a magician-like ******* *****), and ** ****** Jr.(a pompous Rod Perth) also give memorable supporting performances.<br /><br />The Late Shift certainly is one of the best made-for-TV movies I have ever seen. I suppose if one has not watched ***** ********* or *** ****, The Late Shift might not be for them but it is an interesting film for those who get into the late night politics - something that has recently reared its ugly head yet again with the 2009-10 Conan/****/NBC debacle.
