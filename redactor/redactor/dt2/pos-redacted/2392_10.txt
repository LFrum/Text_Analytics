I've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now. When a writer develops a story he always has a character/actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in **** ***** playing uncle ***** in ***** Monroe. This was a slick film highlighted by *****'s presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over narration is also heard). I also especially liked the actress playing *****'s niece and *****'s ex-wife, although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double-crossing that goes with it. A nice job all around ... and *** ***** shined brightest. He's gotta be my **** ***** someday ...
