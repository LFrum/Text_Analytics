Oscar-Winners:****** and **** are both extraordinary good in the film. The movie is even occasionally funny and quite disturbing at times. ***** ****** nearly steals the show as the man, who works for the Soviet Union. This picture has a familiar cast in the supporting roles. It was quite underrated, when it was first released. Despite some great reviews by some of the top film critics. This picture is actually based on a true story. There's some flaws in the storytelling, like these two leads characters but overall, it's a movie worth seeing. Based on a novel by ****** *******. Screenplay by Oscar-Winner:****** ******** (American Gangster, Hannibal, *********'s List). (****/*****).
