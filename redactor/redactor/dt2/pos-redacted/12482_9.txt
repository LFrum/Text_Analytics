First, the obviousas a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama, QUAY  is disconcerting ,straightly independent and a menace to banality. ******'s aplomb is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its vigor and exuberant force; his ******* is not so much a man of intellect, but a man of vast life experience and earthly instinct. QUAY  is not subversive in the sense that today's (and already yesterday's ) philistines enjoy using the word. It is *******'s most playful hour. He tended to adapt *******'s books in a satiric note. (It's said that ******* was a big reader of detective novels.) As a director, *******'s firm hand is successful. <br /><br />It is not a mystery or a thriller,but a satirical look at a Parisian couple and at the police's proceedings. Those accustomed with *******'s masterpiece LES DIABOLIQUES might find slightly disconcerting the multiplicity of things, styles, elements in QUAY .Here ******* speaks about many things, about a couple, and a hidden love story (****** ******'s for *****),about the entertainment's world and about old spinsters, about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise, etc.. There is a note of exuberancenot only in ******'s performance, but also in the film's conception. <br /><br />Quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire. It offers an outstanding performance by ****** as a tough police inspector. ******* is an old cop with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa ,but did not climb the ranks' stair because of his independent behaviors); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; at work, ******* is tough and merciless, an able inspector, bitter, intelligent and harsh. It is a role of great gusto, very picturesque. ****** composed his character of several defining traitshis clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality, and that mocking air .******* is not made to look more clever than plausible; when he interrogates *****, ******* makes mistakes ,and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real lifemixed with errors and lacunae and defects. *******'s talent is one that comes also from experience, from daily observationit's not the almost supernatural _divinatory genius of almost all the famous detectives.<br /><br />QUAY  is multifacetedit is a realistic crime drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. One can consider it among the first _filmic forays into the legendary toughness of the French police. Long ago ********'s and *****'s harsh cops, there was *******. <br /><br />The title is interesting, suggesting that this is a movie about the police, not about a case or a mystery. <br /><br />As craftsmanship, ******* was perhaps the best and sharpest in France (in the way that ****** was). QUAY  is very true to *******'s naturea sardonic comic, sharp observations, much psychology, sharp, unsparing irony. The man was firstclass when he filmed somethinghe knew what to shoot, what to choosesee the introductory scenes of this film, with ***** ******'s great stage success. Each scene is memorably, _exemplarily shot. *******'s technical, stylistic aptitudes were amazing. His style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely limpid, ingenious. <br /><br />******'s style was exuberant, powerful, vehement. (Some disliked it precisely for these features. As he had been a great stage actor, his movie style was deemed as too theatrical, etc..) His ******* is a fine example of what was meant by composing a role, by a composition. <br /><br />****** had a very peculiar physiognomymuch like a menacing bird of preysomewhat like *** Cleefyet much subtler, nobler and more intelligent and distinguished. ****** had this predatory, ferocious air, and it is useful here, as he performs an old tough cop. One of QUAY 's sides is that it is a ****** recital. He is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his play (I see that many, watching this flick, do not know it is a ****** moviewhich is an astounding quality in itself). <br /><br />Fresnay and ****** are the two French actors that I admire the most; the first one was revealed to me by a Renoir drama (the famous one), while ****** by a Carné comedy. I was charmed to see that ******* gave leading roles to both of them.<br /><br />To end, a word about *******; he wrote the novel used by ******* (who had previously adapted another ******* novel, as a Fresnay comedy). ******* was an old school mystery writer, in the Wallace vein. He became quickly outdated with the new hardboiled fashions. When I was 11 I have read one of his thrillers, and liked it much.
