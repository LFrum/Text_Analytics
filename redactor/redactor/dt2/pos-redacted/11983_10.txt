I went to see this film because ******* de ******* was in it. ******* had a fairly small part, so it was good that I liked the film on it's own. In fact, I liked it a lot!<br /><br />The film centers around two characters, ****** and *****. ****** is a shy, retiring sort, and *****... well ***** is not. The story revolves around *****'s request to ****** to let him come over to ******'s place for just a little while. ***** has just gotten out of prison.<br /><br />****** and ***** have known each other since childhood, and of course whenver they do something together there is trouble and it's ****** who always takes the fall.<br /><br />The action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from *****'s visit. On The Run is a chronicle of mad-cap, zany, situations. However, ***** de ******* and scriptwriter, ****** ****** (After Hours), don't always take you where you expect to go. There are twists and turns that add depth to this film. Of course there is plenty of outright comedy, but there is much subtle humor here as well.<br /><br />There are some downright good performances here as well. ****** is played delightfully by ******* *********. He's getting fairly well-knownthese days from the HBO series, The Sopranos.<br /><br />***** is played by **** ***********, who imbues his character with a lovable, child-like quality. (no matter what he does, you just gotta love *****!).<br /><br />Both these actors are excellent in their individual characters. With *********, you'll want to hug him and bring him home to Mom. Ventimiglia, well, you won't know whether you should slap him or bring him home (and NOT to Mom!).<p><br /><br />There are other stand-out performances as well. The character of **** is played by ***** ****** (yes, ******'s daughter). The audience adored her. In talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was ****** or ***** who was their favorite of those two. But, everyone loved ****!<br /><br />Is this film perfect? No, I can't say that it is. There were many times I wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with. There were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget to work with and I believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and notice.)<br /><br />The ending sequence was a bit of a victim of budget. Yet, budget or no budget, the ending screen shot, in my opinion, brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable, emotionally effective scene.<br /><br />
