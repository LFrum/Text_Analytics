****** **** ******* (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre ******** film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible. Since I've been discovering ******** and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by ****** ******, before ******** would come and stake his claim on french neo-noir.<br /><br />****** **** ******* has two of the best lead men of the time, **** ******* and ********* ********. Ventura plays ****, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two kids, who wants to come back to Paris because the police are closing in on him. After a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise, **** eventually gets hooked up with **** ***** (Belmondo) who wants to get into the criminal underworld. ***** becomes ****'s chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on **** after everything he's done and been through. The film shows the the duality of the two men, the older **** at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him, and the younger Eric starting off the same way **** did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of. It never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. Its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise, its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him.<br /><br />Much like ********'s film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. As usual, as what I feel with ********'s films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what I missed the first time. ****** **** ******* is a definite keeper.
