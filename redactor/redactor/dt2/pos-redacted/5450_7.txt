This is a clever and entertaining film about the backroom battling that went on to choose a successor to ****** ****** on the ******* ****. However, the movie's ultimate thesis, that ***** *********'s superior comedic talents were overlooked because of his controversial nature, and the show diminished by the enthronement of an inferior *** **** in the leading comedy program on television is simply untrue, as anyone who has watched both **** and ********* perform can see for themselves. The hard and simple truth is exactly as one NBC exec stated in the film "*** **** is the funniest man in America." And ***** ********* is not. Once you realize this, then much of the machinations in the film become irrelevant. Ultimately, the whole film amounts to little more than sour grapes by ********* fans, who just cannot accept that the better comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kind of things. The final proof is that despite *********'s early lead, possibly because of the hype that emerged from the battle for ******* **** succession, ****'s show has consistently proved to be the more popular, thus, in my mind at least, refuting *********'s claims to be unfairly robbed of his rightful inheritance.
