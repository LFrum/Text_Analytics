When one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of ***** ***** and ****** ***********, "They Died With ***** ***** On" (1941) is most likely the film remembered best. It is the sweeping saga of General ****** (Flynn) - told from the time he enters West Point military academy and falls for the luscious ********* ***** (DeHavilland), through his tenure during the American Civil War, and finally with his death at Little Big Horn. Director, ***** ***** mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts, rewritten by screen writers ***** ***** and ****** *********, until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion. Hence, the battle against Chief ***** ***** (******* *****) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - California Joe (******* ********) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land ****** gave to the Indians through the systematic genocide of the Nation's first peoples. <br /><br />Flynn, who cleverly plays ****** as though he is one part Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts ****** **********, has never been more ignoble. He literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner stock players, ****** ******* and ****** *********** deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them.<br /><br />Overall, then, despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, "They Died With ***** ***** On" is ample film fodder for a Saturday matin√©e or Sunday night cooing with one's sweetheart. Warner's DVD is pretty nice looking. Although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. Some fading is obvious during scene transitions. The audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level.
