Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933? It should have been ***** **** ****** for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever. She truly is one of the great character actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "*******" (1936) and her best remembered role is **** ******** in "Gone With the Wind".<br /><br />***** ***** was the "official" star of the film but her scenes with ***** **** ****** were dynamite.<br /><br />***** (**** ******) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (***** *****) can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Centre. Their first stop in America is a visit to *****'s mother, Mrs. Phelps. To say that ***** **** ****** dominates every scene is an under-statement. From her first entrance - in a frantic burst of effort to greet her "big boy" - all attention is on her. Even sitting around the tea table, when she forgets ******'s existence, even forgetting how she takes her tea, you know something is not quite right.(****** has been living there for a while.)<br /><br />Frances Dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable ******. Her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how under-rated as an actress she was.<br /><br />All the young cast are excellent. **** ****** is superb as ******, the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother's spell. **** ******, at one point says "painting roses on bathtubs - that's more your style". There is a very subtle suggestion in the film of ******'s sexuality.<br /><br />***** ***** is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried.
