I think this is ***** *****'s best stuff, he played the part perfect. I really enjoyed this movie, ******* ***** is really funny as Zack the annoying little brother. *** In Law is a good comedy worth your time, but the only thing I wish ******* ******** was the farm chick instead of the one they had.
