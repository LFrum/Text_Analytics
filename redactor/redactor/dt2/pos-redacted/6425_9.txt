A very insightful psychological thriller! Footprints is a stylish example of the 70's powerful Italian film making.And ***** *******, a wrongly underrated director and visually amazing 'auteur'. The movie develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints,especially in its sad and dramatic finale! Florinda ****** delivers an excellent performance,rich of nuances and touching sensitivity,being able to portray a dark lady who is not only fascinating,but also painfully real and tragically lonesome.But the all cast is a treat,as well! **** Kedrova,********* ****(the mysterious kid by the beach),Italian screen legend ******** ******* and stunningly beautiful B movie queen ****** ******* in the brief but haunting role of the protagonist's friend! And ***** ****** in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! It's peculiar to notice how incredibly well done movies like Footprints were! ******** Storaro's moody and creepy cinematography,stylized locations and sets,****** *******'s haunting score and first of all the story,so intense and disturbing,so intelligently layered and structured! A thriller with fantastic elements,but especially with a soul and a personal vision. I wish movies like Footprints would not be forgotten! I wish the movies were more insightful and personal today as they were back in the 60's/70's! And yes..i wish somebody will soon make a digitally remastered widescreen DVD out of this little masterpiece!
