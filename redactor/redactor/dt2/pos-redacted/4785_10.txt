********* ***** was not the first cartoon to feature ****** *****. The first film to star America's friend was "***** *****". "***** *****" was released May 15th 1928 in Hollywood California,in the silent movie format. "********* *****" was released November 18th 1928 as a SOUND movie (it was also released July 29th 1928 as a silent film). Thus making "*********.."the first SOUND film of Mickey but NOT the first film for the little American Mouse. While many game shows have used the question: "What was the first appearance of ****** *****?" The true answer is "***** *****" not "********* *****". These dates can be checkout on IMDb under "release dates".
