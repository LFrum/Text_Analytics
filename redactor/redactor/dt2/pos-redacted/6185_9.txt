***** ******** gave us wonderful films like Design for Living, *********, The Shop around the Corner, To be or not to be, and other wonderful films. But ****** usually put *********'s eighth wife as one of ********'s weakest films.<br /><br />But I consider this film as an important film. This film began the collaboration of ******* ******** and ***** ******. ******* ********, ***** ******, and ****** ****** wrote the screenplay for ***** ********'s *********. Of Course, ******** worked with writers in the scripting process. After that, ******* ******** and ***** ****** worked together. They together wrote the screenplay for famous films like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd.<br /><br />There are lots of funny moments in the film. I thought "The Taming of the Shrew" was very funny. There is a famous expression called "Films are slices of Life." And Here is a great example from *********'s eighth wife (1938).<br /><br />At the first session of the scripting process, ******** posed this question: how do the boy and girl get together? ***** ****** promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop of a department store. "The boy is trying to buy a pajama," he extemporized glibly. "But he sleeps only in the tops. He is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops. The clerk says he must buy the pants too. It looks like a catastrophe. Then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants." ***** ******** and ******* ******** were enchanted. It wasn't till months later they discovered that ***** ****** himself is a tops-only sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it.<br /><br />I got this information from a book. I think this film can be considered as the return of ***** ********. Right after this film, he made wonderful films like *********, The Shop around the Corner, and To be or not to be.<br /><br />I thought **** ******'s performance was good. I think ******** casted **** ****** probably because **** ****** played **** ****** Deeds who inherited the fortune in Frank Capra's Mr. Deeds goes to town. But this is just my opinion.<br /><br />As for me, I highly enjoyed the film. I rate this film 9 out of 10. ******** films are different, because his films are slices of life.
