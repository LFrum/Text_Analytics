***** *****'s '**** ****' (so called despite the fact that the **** ****** clearly says "Meep Meep") is the second of the exceptionally popular **** ****** series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor, the historically important but lacklustre 'Fast and Furry-ous'. While it features several predictable quickfire gags, '**** ****' also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. Chief among these is a fantastic, extended chase through an old mine in which we see the Coyote and the **** ****** represented by two small lights. There's also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket-powered roller-skates. '**** ****' also sees a great improvement in the representation of **** ** ******. Not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in 'Fast and Furry-ous' but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain. Although it's a little slow to get going (too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags), once '**** ****' arrives at the mine shaft sequence it's clear that ***** was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better **** ****** cartoons than '**** ****' but there's a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon, as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario.
