There is, as many reviews have observed, a strong dark streak to this movie. The director it most recalls to me is **** ****** (yeah, go ahead and howl about what a peasant I am). Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a bleak, gray kind of way, then turning round and exploring the horrors of life with a lighthearted touch.<br /><br />The cast is, without exception, above average. ****** ******, as *****, is outstanding as the moody and self-deceptive center around whom the rest of the characters revolve. He talks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge. ****** was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. It was difficult to look at him and see **** **********, let alone ***** ******** of Criminal Minds.<br /><br />Perhaps not the best scene, but the one I enjoy most, my "rewind scene," is the section where ***** is expecting a visitor, and one uninvited person after another shows up at the door. As *****'s interpersonal environment swings further and further out of control, ***** just grows bouncier, perkier, and more enthusiastic, like a gaunt Gen-X "Tigger."
