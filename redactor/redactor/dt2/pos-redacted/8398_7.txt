I watch this movie without big expectations, I think everyone should do. It's a great Tv-serie and of course we couldn't compare it with **** With the wind, but it's still nice to watch. It's also weird to see a different ********. ****** Whalley don't play ******** with passion and fire like ****** *****, but I believe that ******** is changed when she became older. Don't expect to much of this just watch but don't watch like: I think this would be horrible.
