If the caper genre owes a lot to ****** ******, it also has a debt of gratitude to ***** ******, a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when ****** ******* accused him of being a Communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of *** ******, but moving to Europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his Hollywood demise.<br /><br />"Rififi" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to *** ******'s vision. He decided to adapt ******* ** ******'s novel because he saw the possibilities for turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic. ***** ****** was penniless in Paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film. The bad weather paid off for *** ****** as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way.<br /><br />When we first meet ****, he is playing cards. **** appears to be in bad health; he coughs all the time and sweats profusely. After losing all his money, he goes to see **, the Swede, who tells him about a possibility for a robbery at Maupin & ****, the fancy jewelry store at a tony section of Paris. They pass the idea through *****, who suggests *****, the Milanese, an expert safe cracker.<br /><br />****, who has come out of prison recently, learns that ****, his former lover is now with *******, a creep that owns a night club. Upon confronting ****, instead of love, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place. ******* has no love for ****, who is his natural enemy because of his connection with ****.<br /><br />When the day arrives, the gang is able to get to the apartment building where on the second floor, right above the jewelry store, the owner lives, but he is away. Everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels. *****, the Milanese, a typical ladies' man, takes a ring as a souvenir, which in turn he gives the chanteuse at the *******'s night club. This tactical mistake is the spark which unravels the well thought plan.<br /><br />**** ******* made an excellent ****. He showed a tired man who was possibly doing his last robbery. **** Mohner, ****** ****** and the director, ***** ******, are seen as **, ***** and *****, the quartet jewelry thieves. ***** Sabouret plays ****. ****** Lupovici plays ******* with a subdued intensity. ****** *******, who would go to direct movies later on, makes an impression with his Remi, one of *******'s men.<br /><br />The film best asset is the great camera work by ******** ********, who captured the atmosphere of Paris and the locales where all these criminals operate from. ******* *****'s music plays well with the action in the film. ***** ****** was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed, and unfortunately, that is our loss because this man was a genius as proved mainly with "The Naked City", "Night and the City" and "Rififi".
