Just exactly HOW director **** ****** come to settle with ******* **** and ******** **** playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: "Captain Correli´s Mandolin", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by **** amid horrendous over-acting, with **** -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite ****** **** in "Blow" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.<br /><br />The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and **** does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability. Next, a superb performance by **** **** (****´s father, the village doctor) of ***** ********, as well as by ***** *****, each as village elders, as well as by ********* **** (Papas´ son) among the village freedom fighters, go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by **** and ****. Nicely, the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses, but it´s teeth-gnashing early on. Finally, the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award, and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed. <br /><br />**** **** already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as the Doctor makes this film worth seeing. The true test of a supporting actor/actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question, and in this case, it would most certainly not be... not even close.<br /><br />Entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar. See it if you haven´t. Rating = 3.5 stars (of five).
