The creepy demons "The Gentlemen" capture the voice of the population of Sunnydale, to steal human hearts without scream. Giles find that in accordance with a legend, if a lady screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but ***** and her friends, including *****, have to fight the monsters speechless.<br /><br />"Hush" is certainly the best episode of the Fourth Season of ***** up to this moment. Having lots of humor and funny situations, I liked a lot. Spike is hilarious, the romance between ****** and Anya is cool, but I loved the "intense" dialog between ***** and ***** in end. The Gothic scenario of the final battle against "The Gentlemen" recalls the environment of "**** ****". My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "SilÃªncio" ("Silence")
