***SPOILERS*** This film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of ****** ****** to determine who would succeed him. The impersonations of ***** ********* and *** **** are performed in a satisfactory way by **** ******* ******* and ****** *******, though the performances weren't great. **** Santoni is the best-performing of the "execs" (he plays **** ******* of NBC), and ****** *********** (played by *** *******) is a close second. I was shocked at the way in which *********** eagerly discussed dumping ****** ******. This was ****** ******! This scene evinces the cut-throat, what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world of television. ***** ***** delivered the best performance of the film as ***'s agent, ***** ********. Another commenter asserted that **** was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. I respectfully disagree. The relationship with ******** bordered on something akin to domestic violence. She orders him around, and, when he rebels against her at the end, she tries to play the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however, when *** terminates their relationship, she turns violent again, screaming "Don't you leave me, you two-faced bastard!" before smashing a picture on the floor. Overall, the movie is hilarious, and I wish that it were shown more often.
