In Queen of The Damned,******(*******) was more sexy and had a bigger,demanding presence, she just caught your eye and attention. now the movie did have faults, like the lack of explaining ******'s past. What i also Did not like was the that the movie didn't really explain or show more of what the relationship between ****** and ****** was/ or was like.******'s (*******'s) role was sort of limited in the movie and she didn't appear until the 2nd half of the movie and then to top it off, her(******'s) death came 2 quickly.But i liked how ****** fought back when the ancients tried to kill her, because in the book the last fight between ****** and The ancients was rather boring (they killed ****** in like 2 secs).******'s head got knocked off in 1 sec and ****** turned into the biggest punk in the world.<br /><br />******* played ****** very well and ****** was perfect as ******, they could not have picked a better ****** or ******.
