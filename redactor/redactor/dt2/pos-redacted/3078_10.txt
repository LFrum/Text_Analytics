I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic *** ****** style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to **** *****, and **** ********* and what a first impression they made. **** ***** shines as ***** ****, the only British ***** **** mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. **** ********* is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as *****. The characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!
