As with all ****** films, make your own decision--don't be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends, see it yourself. ******** ******* is stunning in this film--combined with ******, these two never pull their punches. ****** reels us in with the lure of golden boy, ****** *******, but this is an anti-romance as much as ***** ***** was an anti-thriller. You'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly nervy and thought provoking; ****** continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitised Western civilization is or has become. People may turn their noses up at this but it's only taking what ******* did in Happiness a few steps further. While grounded in reality, much of what Erika (*******) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor. I'm not recommending it but I wouldn't dissuade you either...it definitely divides people but given it's largely about repression--that's no surprise.
