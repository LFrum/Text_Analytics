Of all the major 30s star actresses, ****** ******* has been the most bizarrely overlooked and underrated. Her string of excellent 30s and 40s films is quite impressive but she is often referred to as stagy or brittle. Yet she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including this film, *** ************ (with ***** *****), and The Smiling Lieutenant (with ******* ********* and ********* *******). ******* was famous for her dislike of Hollywood, and the results has been a bad rep--undeserved.<br /><br />In Wise Girl she play an heiress trying to rescue the children of her dead sister from their guardian--the sister's brother-in-law (Ray *******). The film offers several hilarious scene such as ******* taking a bath is a storeroom, ******* joining ******* and ***** ******** in a Greenwich Village restaurant for $3 apiece to act as "bohemians," and ******* going ringside during one of ********' fights. ******* is also excellent and very funny.<br /><br />******* and ******* make a great couple. The film also boasts solid support from ********, ****** ****, ***** **********, ***** *********, ******** ******, ***** *****, ****** *******, and **** *******. The two girls are OK.<br /><br />But *******, drunk on a "slice of wine" and wearing a pinned-together dress that is twice her size is hilarious as she blows at stray hairs while smoking.... A scream.
