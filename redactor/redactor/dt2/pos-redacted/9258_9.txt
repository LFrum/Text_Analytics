The movie was excellent, save for some of the scenes with ********. I enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series, and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series (thanks to NBC...). It was great to see ********* and ******* together at their most human, and most basic persons. ******** and ***** did a great job, but as usual will get overlooked. It hurt to see that this was the end of Homicide. Memories, tapes, and reruns on CourtTV just aren't the same as watching it come on every Friday. But the movie did its job and did it very well, presenting a great depiction of life after ** retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I enjoyed this a lot.
