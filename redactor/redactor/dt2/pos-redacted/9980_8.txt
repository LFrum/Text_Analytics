**** LaBeouf has impressed me before with his acting ability, but I can honestly say that I very much look forward to his next efforts...his portrayal of ******* ******, a 20 year old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his place in life and enters the 1913 US Open tournament in his hometown...the beginning of the movie does drag a bit, but it's necessary to set up the underdog subplot that **** works so well...the entire cast is well-chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the actual event, has an ending everyone can discover before seeing the movie...but even knowing that information doesn't spoil the fun...**** ******* is delightful as ***** ******, *******' caddy, who keeps him grounded and loose while at the same time proving to be an invaluable part of *******' effort...******* ****** is outstanding as ***** ******, the legendary British golfer who ******* idolizes yet does not fear...and who knows the background ******* comes from as he, too, had humble beginnings...**** ****** takes a formulaic movie and makes it worthwhile...bravo *** ******, and bravo to the cast...from the imagery to the story to the people who bring it alive, this is a movie to get, enjoy, and revel in...it's nice to have movies like this that we can feel good watching...
