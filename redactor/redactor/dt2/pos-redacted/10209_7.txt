**** to believe this was directed by ***** **** since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries. This movie has a cast that includes ****** *****, ******** *****, **** ****** and **** *********. ***** plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving ******'s life. ****** works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west. ****** hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. ***** is in charge of the men and ***** is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride. ***** meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but ***** can't tell anyone. It's a pretty good western and **** should of directed some more westerns.
