On first January 01, 2001, I was dispatched to 962 loggerhead island drive in reference to a disturbance between the occupants. Upon arrival of Officer William and myself, we met with Jenny Johnson. She states she and her boy friend were at a friend’s house. Earlier this evening and argued about child custody matters from her previous marriage. Jake left the gathering went home. Upon Johnson's arrival home she noticed some of her personal items and had been boxed up and placed by the front door. According to Johnson, she attempted to go into their bedroom and get some other belongings but was unable because Jake had locked the door and would not let her enter. She also stated that incident did not involve any physical altercation. Her cell number is (405) 555-8888.
